Welcome to Building [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) Clone with Next.js series!

In this first part, I'll briefly introduce what we'll be building, the tools, and set up of the project.

**_Disclaimer_**: This is **not a React** tutorial, but more focusing on the overall Next.js workflow and a brief touch on other tools used.

_Sneak Peek:_

## Prerequisites

It is expected for you to at least know a little about **React**, and **Tailwind**. I also used **TypeScript** extensively, but should be comprehensible for most.

## Introduction to Next.js

You probably know what [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is if you're clicking this article. Anyways, here's the description from Vercel, creator of Next.js

> Used by some of the world's largest companies, Next.js enables you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.
>
> â€” Vercel Team

The keywords are full-stack web applications, so yeah, it's the dream of all frontend developers, **doing backend in frontend**, making frontend programmers worthier.

Jokes aside, Next.js is capable of both **frontend** and **backend** development, so you can learn a single framework to do **fullstack** development in a single code base. Also, we can build **Single Page Applications** (SPA) easily using Next.js.

_Disclaimer: You still need to know things like database and design patterns to be a good backend developer._

## What are We Building

I'll only be implementing some of the features for this clone, but the list may expand as I go on:

1. Viewing Story
2. Post Content
3. Follower Logic
4. Viewing Profile

That's it, more than enough for us to get started

_Disclaimer: I'm not building a mobile-responsive website_

## Design

Since it's a fullstack application, let's go over the **entire development cycle** starting from the **design phase** including both front and back-end. Jump ahead to the next part if you wish to skip the design phase, but this part will provide a good **overview** of the app that we're building.

### Frontend

Most of the designs will be **taken directly** from the Instagram website (_it's a clone anyways_), but I'll doodle some **low-fidelity prototypes** to better identify the required endpoints and objects to design the backend later.

<ImgurImage

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="cOLQFhi"
  format="png"
  alt="Low fidelity prototype of profile page"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

While the designs don't certainly cover every endpoint required, but they are a **good starting point**.

Note that these designs also **don't cover all components**, there are still many missing parts, but our goal right now will be trying to get these basics out first.

### Database

From the frontend design, we can at least identify a few entities like User, Post, Story, UserFollower, and PostLike. To visualize these entities, we'll draw a **class diagram** of them:

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="HGlzube"
  format="png"
  alt="Class diagram of the database"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

It's not the nicest diagram in the world, but it should suffice.

Note that I have a special **Image** class outside, it's a polymorphic class that'll be attached to Post / Story / User, depending on the `type` field. Otherwise, it's pretty much done, we can just move on.

And that's basically it, a fresh-baked class diagram ready to be used. In practice, a class diagram is quite helpful when you want to communicate the database design with others (_or otherwise others will have to guess the design from database structure / schema file, which might not necessary be bad_)

## Getting Started

Note: I'll be using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) due to personal preference, but feel free to use pnpm or npm.

I'll just set up the **frontend** here for starter, the backend will be set up in their respective articles.

### Next.js template

Normally, for large frameworks like Next.js, they usually provide a **starter template** that bootstraps the project with the necessary tools / configs to get started.

Launch your terminal, `cd` into the folder, and let's start with the create-next-app

```bash
yarn create next-app
```

Here are the options I used

1. **Project Name**: insta-next
2. **TypeScript**: I'd recommend you try out TypeScript if you haven't, but feel free to go with vanilla JavaScript
3. **ESLint**: Helps to identify your bad code patterns, use it if you wish to take out your bad habits
4. **src/ directory**: It's a personal preference, and I came from a background of using src, so yes for me
5. **app/ directory**: You can read more [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/02/understanding-app-directory-architecture-next-js/), but since we're building a simple application, I'll skip it, plus it's still experimental anyways
6. **import alias**: basically @/ means the root of the repository, without it, the import will be filled with "../../.." which is kinda ugly, so I added it in

### Frontend

I'll just set up the UI part here, the specific libraries for state management and usequery hooks will be later in their specific parts.

#### Component

I have decided to use [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) because I like its **form** usage, plus it has a **carousel**, which is exactly what we're going to use. The best part is that it has tonnes of components, a perfect library. Let's set it up following the docs

```bash
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @mantine/form @mantine/modals @mantine/nprogress @emotion/react @emotion/server @mantine/carousel @mantine/next
```

I've also added `@mantine/hooks` for utility hooks, `@mantine/modals` for modal management and `@mantine/nprogress` for the progress bar effect while transitioning.

I'll set up the `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` following the [documentation](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/)

```typescript
// _app.tsx
import { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import Head from 'next/head';
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

export default function App(props: AppProps) {
  const { Component, pageProps } = props;

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Page title</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width" />
      </Head>

      <MantineProvider
        withGlobalStyles
        withNormalizeCSS
        theme={{
          /** Put your mantine theme override here */
          colorScheme: 'light',
        }}
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MantineProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

```typescript
// _document.tsx
import { createGetInitialProps } from '@mantine/next';
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';

const getInitialProps = createGetInitialProps();

export default class _Document extends Document {
  static getInitialProps = getInitialProps;

  render() {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Tailwind

Yes, I know it's a bit weird to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) along with a component library, but the issue with current Mantine is its **lack of granularity**, like there's only xs, sm, md, lg and xl for sizes, which are insufficient for most cases. Also, Mantine allows us to use **classNames** to style the components, including the inner parts.

Let's install tailwind

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

and also update the `content` in your `tailwind.config.js`, as all of the codes will lie in the src directory, this pattern will match **every React component** in it to allow Tailwind to compile CSS files from it

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
```

and not to forget, remember to update the `globals.css` for tailwind directives, remove everything, and add these two lines in, which will **reset all component styles** and allow us to **start using Tailwind classes**

_I know I have missed component, but I'm probably not going to use it in this project, so I'm leaving it aside._

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### Directory Structure

Now that we're done with the libraries, it's time to organize the folders. We'll be creating the folders under `/src` directory.

```plaintext
src
|- components  # for storing frontend components
|- features    # for backend features
|- pages       # page routes
|- stores      # for state management later
|- styles      # Global styles
|- utils       # Utility functions if there's any
```

#### Page Routes

Next.js uses [directory based routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction). The **location** of the page component in the `pages` folder will indicate its route. For example, `/src/pages/index.tsx` will be mapped to the route `/` and `/src/pages/auth/register.tsx` to `/auth/register`.

This will make it very convenient to manage the routes compared to the traditional router page.

For [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), we can wrap the parameter name with `[square_brackets]`. It can be used in both folder or component. For example, routes like `/users/shen_yien` or `/users/john_doe` will be resolved to `/src/pages/users/[username].tsx` or `/src/pages/users/[username]/index.tsx`.

## Development

When you run `yarn dev` and visit your `localhost:3000` you should see this

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="rpsO7Tq"
  format="png"
  alt="Nextjs Homepage"
  width={700}
  height={400}
/>

Nothing's wrong there, we've removed everything from global, so naturally the styles are gone. Just hang tight there while we develop

## Summary

In this article, we have created a simple **low-fidelity design**, set up the necessities for our **frontend development**, and started up our development server. In the upcoming articles, we will start with the backend development.
