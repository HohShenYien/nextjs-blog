A little background of myself, I am currently in my senior bachelor's degree year, with an ongoing [part-time job](https://www.mindworks.xyz/), while being the president of a [club](https://apu-apac.netlify.app/). It certainly wasnâ€™t easy to take care of all those while ensuring my mental and physical health.

## Managing Tasks

Frankly speaking, Iâ€™m not the to-do kind of person, I donâ€™t list down what I want to do every day.

Rather, every Sunday, Iâ€™ll leave a **mental note** (yeah, not a physical note) to myself on the goals to achieve for every side of my life. If they are urgent, I write them down.

I know that life does not go smoothly, bugs may creep up and I need to fix them immediately, lecturers announcing tests, or my car may break down anytime, so I decided to **go along the flow**, with the general direction of accomplishing the goals.

Sounds lame, huh? No sticky notes, journals, or whatsoever, this is how a messy guy manages his life, but itâ€™s been working well for me!

## Doing the Tasks

So, how do I exactly settle the goals? Well, most of the time it follows where my heart goes as long as the **direction is right**.

### Multitasking

I have about 18 hours of classes each week, and including commute time, I probably spend at least 22 hours per week on lecture classes.

However, thanks to my learning habit, I was already familiar with several things that were to be covered during the classes. This has allowed me to **focus on other tasks during classes** (I know itâ€™s probably not good) and read on the slides afterward.;

### Wasting No Time

As long as Iâ€™m bringing my laptop with me, I can do my tasks anytime, anywhere. Thatâ€™s how I try to use every available time possible.

During the breaks, during the commute (sometimes), and at home, if possible, Iâ€™d continue to work on whatever Iâ€™ve left off earlier.

### Getting into Zone

I believe I saw this in many places, ***starting to do something is the hardest part*** and yes, it applies to me too.

As long as I put myself into the work, Iâ€™d be able to focus for a long time till Iâ€™m done with my tasks. Of course, this doesnâ€™t apply to everything, it mostly concerns the programming part.

However, non-programming tasks are harder to focus on for me, like doing written assignments and listening to lectures.

## My This Week

Iâ€™ll show how it went by this week.

1.  For **part-time**, I was supposed to finish up authentication, and user settings.
    
2.  For **university**, I needed to contact lecturers to seek advice for my Final Year Project & attending every class for attendance. (Assignment season hasnâ€™t arrived ðŸ¤¥)
    
3.  For **my club**, I had to write a weekly report, and review the preparation for this Saturdayâ€™s events.
    
4.  For my **website**, I wanted to finish the remaining parts this week.
    
5.  Lastly, for **myself**, I wanted to read more and do more exercises.
    

Phew, quite a few things there.

What about priority, you ask? Itâ€™s a very simple one, **Results &gt; Part-time&gt; Club &gt; Me**. My main goal now is still to maintain my &gt;**3.7 CGPA** to get first-class results.

### Commitments

One thing for sure is that the part-time job is a continuous commitment, I must spend several hours per day doing them, but at least the timing is more flexible.

Meanwhile, I have to attend every class in university, but as online is still a viable option, I chose to attend virtually except for certain specific classes to save more time.

Club work is more towards a responsibility, as I was being trusted with the work, I ought to give my best, Iâ€™d spend up to 6 hours per week sometimes, dealing with meetings, and other stuff related to the club.

Finally, I didnâ€™t want to drag my website any further, so I decided to spend more time finishing it up too.

## Challenges

### Losing Focus

As I said, I canâ€™t focus equally well on all tasks, primarily, non-programming tasks. I do get distracted myself.

More often than not, Iâ€™d start browsing social media like Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, and even GitHub Explore, to procrastinate and distract myself.

Honestly, it might not be all bad for me. I donâ€™t get distracted when Iâ€™m having a lot of ideas, but during which I donâ€™t know how to progress. It usually wonâ€™t take more than a few mins, though, then Iâ€™d get back to my work.

### Mental Health

On the other hand, Iâ€™ve been more concerned about this issue recently.

Sometimes stress will just creep up, and Iâ€™d get anxious about not being to finish anything. Luckily, as things get lesser recently (this happened when I was doing two internships), this doesnâ€™t happen as much.

I do worry that itâ€™ll come up again as university assignments begin to pop up.

Anyways, I believe that as long as I can cope with it, itâ€™ll be all well, and in the end, the results will be more rewarding.

## Rewards

And finally, what did I get from all this hard work?

1.  **Experience**
    
    While most of my peers just had a four-month internship experience, I managed to accumulate over a yearâ€™s development experience. Not just in terms of job prospects, but these experiences have widened my horizon in the field.
    
2.  **Skills & Knowledge**
    
    Well, not just from work experience, but reading as well has brought me a significant amount of knowledge. I grew a lot just within a year, and it has been almost a different person compared to myself a year ago.
    
3.  **Social Circle**
    
    Along the way, I met many interesting people. Some guided me, some became teammates, and I might have guided the others. They have brought a different tint to my life and though some may have parted, theyâ€™re always in the memory.
    
4.  **Income**
    
    Finally, this is the tangible reward that I can feel every month without much explanation needed ðŸ¤‘.
    

## Do I Regret it?

No, not at all. I believe that somewhere in the future, Iâ€™ll be grateful for what Iâ€™ve done during this time!
