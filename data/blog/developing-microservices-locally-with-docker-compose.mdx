<TOCInline toc={props.toc} />

**Running everything locally** is typically [not recommended](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64251784/24886836) when developing microservices due to their complexity, and instead, alternatives like test-driven development, mocking, or dev servers are preferred.

However, I strongly believe that while you can't run everything locally, it's important to at least **be able to run some** of them locally. This is possible if your services **don't somehow depend on all other services**, essentially building a [distributed monolith](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-building-microservices-distributed-monolith-gireesh-kumar/).

While unit tests cover a lot of use cases, there are times when the **feature can only be tested via integration testing**. For example, your `receipt service` is only triggered by events from the `payment service`, and to test it.

In this case, you'd need to run your CI/CD, wait for some good ol' 20-minute build and test time to find out that you missed a corner case, and wait another 20 minutes to ensure it works... This **DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT.**

Hence, that's why being able to run them locally is a blessing, as it **reduces the testing time** and makes the **feedback cycle faste**r.

## Problems with developing microservices locally

Developing monolithic applications probably only needs to run a single docker container or simply run them locally.

However, in the world of microservices, things aren't that straightforward.

### Starting Multiple Services

  alt="Need to start many services"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

First off, there might be **10 or more microservices** that you need to run at the same time, how are you going to do that?

Starting them manually? Probably not a good idea.

Maybe you can compile the services you need to launch into a single script. Sounds better, but since there are many services, how many scripts do you need to start them, so this is no good too.

### Service Dependencies

  height={300}
/>

Moreover, some services also **depend on other dependencies and each other too**.

For example, most of the microservices probably **depend on your database**, and some on your Redis store or Kafka. In terms of inter-services, your **gateway server might depend on your auth server** and **every service depends on Service Discovery** to communicate.

This makes starting the services manually even less feasible as you now have to consider the dependency graph.

### Other Problems

Beyond running the services, there are still some other significant problems that will **not be addressed by using Docker Compose** (meaning you'll still encounter them despite following this article...), that are worth mentioning.

#### Resource Consumption

Each service **will not consume too much memory**\*(in the scale of hundreds of MBs)\*. However, if you have more than dozens of services... Good luck with that.

Nevertheless, even if you have hundreds of services, you should only **need less than 10 services running** at the same time as each microservice should be as independent as possible (or you run into the distributed monolith antipattern...)

#### Taking too long to run & build

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="zKfaFYx"
  format="png"
  alt="Running & Building is slow"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

Even with Docker Compose, you can't escape from **starting the services**. For me, it is usually in the range of 5 - 10 minutes to start the necessary service dependencies, but if you only work on a single service at a time, this should only happen once per day.

However, if your workflow requires **rebuilding the services**, it might take more than 5 minutes to build and rerun the service you're developing. This long feedback loop is not good, but I will propose a simple workaround by the end of this article.

## Docker & Docker Compose 101

Before we look into the solution, let's briefly discuss Docker and Docker Compose.

### Docker

<ImgurImage

  height={400}
/>

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) allows you to run containers, which are **like virtual machines**, but much more lightweight as it doesn't start a whole operating system. Rather, it **creates isolated environments** in your system to separate each container from one another.

The **container will run images** that contain your **application codes**, typically built and bundled into binary files. In terms of microservices, **each container will usually host a separate microservice**.

[Learn more about Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview/)

### Docker Compose

  height={400}
/>

While Docker allows you to run individual containers, **Docker Compose orchestrates (coordinates) the containers** based on your configuration.

By orchestrating, Docker Compose can **launch multiple containers together**, **following an order** that you define. That is, if your `User Service` depends on `Database Service`, then Docker Compose can ensure that the `Database Service` is started and in healthy state before starting your `User Service`.

Furthermore, Docker Compose also **simplifies the process of mounting**, **networking**, and **other definitions** like health check by allowing you to define them all in one file â€” `docker-compose.yaml`.

## Developing & Building in Docker

Let's first start by preparing 2 Dockerfiles:

1. Dockerfile.dev, and
    
2. Dockerfile.build
    

### Dev Dockerfile

This is the Dockerfile that has only one purpose: development.

Therefore, this particular Dockerfile is typically simple, containing only 4 sections:

1. Environment to run the container in
    
2. Installation of additional OS-level dependencies, typically `curl`
    
3. Setting the working directory
    
4. Setting the entrypoint
    

Let's look at a quick example:

```dockerfile
# Step 1: Defining environment
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine
# Step 2: Any additional OS dependencies
RUN apk add curl

# Step 3: Setting up working directory
## Note: Your codes should be mounted here
WORKDIR /workspace/app

# Step 4: Setting the entrypoint
## This is whatever command to run your service, be it go run, npm start, etc.
ENTRYPOINT ./gradlew :user-service:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'
```

With just 4 simple steps, you have dockerized your local development environment. This can already **eliminate the universal "*This works in my computer*" problem**.

Additionally, you can use this container for **other purposes**, such as testing and linting. The concept is somewhat similar to VS Code's [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) except you don't develop in the container.

By running your container this way, all your changes can be **immediately reflected** (if you're running with hot reload like Nest.js), or you can just restart the container. While it still takes around 2-3 minutes to start up, this is much faster than rebuilding the service entirely.

Note: **Your codes need to be mounted** at `/workspace/app` for it to work.

### Build Dockerfile

Build Dockerfile is usually more specific for the framework that you're building for. You can usually find the Dockerfile template from a quick Google Search. For example, here's a typical Dockerfile for Spring Boot which also uses a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine as build

ARG SERVICE="user-service"
ARG VERSION="0.0.1"
WORKDIR /workspace/app

COPY gradlew settings.gradle build.gradle ./
COPY gradle ./gradle
COPY $SERVICE ./$SERVICE

RUN ./gradlew :$SERVICE:bootJar -x test
RUN mkdir -p $SERVICE/build/libs/dependency && (cd $SERVICE/build/libs/dependency; jar -xf ../$SERVICE-$VERSION.jar)

# Stage 2
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-alpine

ARG SERVICE="user-service"
ARG DEPENDENCY=/workspace/app/$SERVICE/build/libs/dependency

VOLUME /tmp
RUN apk add curl

COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY --from=build ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.yourapp.userservice.UserServiceApplication"]
```

I'll leave the explanation of the Dockerfile to your ChatGPT if you're looking for one.

This Dockerfile is used for building and running your services. It also can be modified slightly for your production use.

### Why Dev & Build Dockerfile?

Typically, running built mode (like jar or binaries) is **faster**, **less resource-intensive**, and **takes less time to start**. Therefore, I do prefer to run the services that I'm not developing in Build mode.

Besides, when I developing with Spring Boot, I noticed that the following error would happen when I tried to run more than 2 services in Dev mode:

```dockerfile
Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly
```

*(Which I believe it's the OS that killed it due to high memory consumption, but the point is made)*

## Developing with Docker Compose

Again, like above, we will have 2 Docker Compose:

1. `docker-compose.yml` for built mode, and
    
2. `docker-compose-dev.yml` for dev mode
    

### Build Mode Docker Compose

In build mode, your main concern will be the **start sequence** and **health check metrics**.

For example, you might have a Postgres database running, and your `User Service` depends on it, so you might need something like:

```yaml
# Each microservice / additional service will be a separate service,
# which will be a separate container
services:
  # The service name
  database:
    # Typical docker stuffs
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgresql
    # Environment variable for the container, refer to the image
    # documentation for usage of each environment variables
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: database
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      PGUSER: postgres
    # Healthcheck metrics for postgres database (1)
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready", "-d", "db_prod" ]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 60s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
    # Exposing the port so that you can access from your local environment
    # You have to make sure that the port is not in use,
    # hence the mapping of postgres 5432 to local 5431 to avoid conflict
    ports:
      - "5431:5432"
    # The postgres data will be persistent so that restarting
    # the container will not erase the data
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    # Networks (2)
    networks:
      backend:
        aliases:
          - database

  # One of your microservices, the user-service (3)
  userservice:
    container_name: user-service
    # Build Context is where the service is located (4)
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: ./user-service/docker/Dockerfile.build
    # Healthcheck metrics (1)
    healthcheck:
      test: "curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | grep UP || exit 1"
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
    # Dependency, to start user-service, it will require the database
    # to be healthy, based on database's health check metrics (3)
    depends_on:
      database:
        condition: service_healthy
    ports:
      - "8074:8080"
    networks:
      - backend

# The persistent data storage will be defined here
volumes:
  pg_data:

# The available network will be listed here
networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

Note:

1. The health check command will be a single command that will be run inside the container to **determine the health status** of the service. The other 4 lines are configurations to determine the frequency and timeouts for the health check.
    
2. The network configuration is important to make sure all microservices are in the **same network** so that they can **communicate** with one another. Alias means that the other services can just use `http://database` to talk to it.
    
3. The dependency is what defines the **sequence of launch**. If one service depends on another, then the other services must start first. With proper configuration, you can start all the necessary services with a single command.
    
4. Build Context is **where your service is located**. This is usually the root folder of the project, and in this context, the Dockerfile path is **relative to the build context**.
    

Of course, this is a simple example, but even if it's just 5 services like this will quickly become complicated to handle the dependencies:

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="9jRw8Mb"
  format="jpg"
  alt="A possible depdency graph with 5 services"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

Even with that complexity, if you have defined your dependencies correctly, all you need to do is to run the following command

```bash
# To build, run docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml build userservice
docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up userservice
```

And the services will be **started with the correct sequence**! This is a huge simplification of the 2 problems mentioned earlier.

### Dev Mode Docker Compose

Lastly, you will also need to prepare a Docker Compose file for development purposes. I usually avoid defining the dependencies here so that it doesn't mix build & dev containers.

```yaml
# Each microservice / additional service will be a separate service,
# which will be a separate container
services:
  # One of your microservices, the user-service
  userservice:
    container_name: user-service
    # Build Context is where the service is located
    build:
      context: ..
      ## Note the use of dev Dockerfile instead of build Dockerfile
      dockerfile: ./user-service/docker/Dockerfile.dev
    # Mounting your codes in read mode (1)
    volumes:
      - ..:/workspace/app:r
    # Healthcheck metrics
    healthcheck:
      test: "curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health | grep UP || exit 1"
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
    ports:
      - "8074:8080"
    # You will want to use the same network name
    networks:
      - backend

networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
```

*Note the missing dependency and the additional volumes in the dev mode.*

About the volumes:

1. The codes (located in `..` relative to the Docker Compose file), are **mounted in read mode** in the workspace directory, this allows any new codes to be **immediately available** to the container.
    

Likewise, you will only need to run the following command to start the service in dev mode

```bash
# To build, run docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-dev.yml build userservice
docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up userservice
```

Again, note that there's no dependency defined, so you might want to start one or two of its dependencies to setup the whole dependency graph.

### Typical Coding Workflow

This is my typical daily coding workflow with this setup:

1. If I was developing `menu-service` earlier, and I am done with it now, I will run
    
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml build menuservice
    ```
    
    to build the build mode container for `menu-service`, and restart it with
    
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml up menuservice
    ```
    
2. If my next task requires me to work with `user-service`, I will then setup the dev mode for `user-service`
    
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-dev.yml build userservice
    ```
    
    and run it
    
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up userservice
    ```
    
3. After I make some changes, I might want to restart the service to see the changes
    
    ```bash
    docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-dev.yml restart userservice
    ```
    

And this is how I utilize Docker Compose in developing microservices.

**Note**: Sometimes you might want to add the flag `-d` in `docker compose up` to run it in detached mode so that you can continue using your terminal.

**Note 2**: I will usually run only the first 2 steps in my terminal, and proceed with using Docker Desktop on the 3rd step since I also need to monitor the logs sometimes.

Docker Compose significantly simplifies the coding workflow when developing microservices. I personally have used it when developing large microservice architecture application and found it to be very useful.
