Leetcode problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

### **Example 1**

```plaintext
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

### **Example 2**

```plaintext
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    
* `s` consist of only digits and English letters.
    

### Note

**Palindrome** refers to a string that **reads the same forward and backward**, the reverse of the string is the same as the string, e.g., hoh, aba, abba…

## Discussion

### Concepts

The concepts in this question are slightly more implicit, but the keyword is on palindrome itself

1. **Dynamic Programming** - Look at any of the palindromes, you’d find that ***the central substring*** of a palindrome is also a palindrome! e.g., in `abcba`, `bcd` and `c` are both palindromes. In other words, we can determine if a string is palindromic by **checking if its substring is palindromic**, and this is the pattern of Dynamic programming: **Solving a problem by solving subproblems**.
    

### Brute Force Attempt

To easily solve the problem, we can just examine all the substrings of `s` and check for the longest palindrome.

1. Iterating all substrings which will require $O(n^2)$ time complexity:
    
    ```python
    longest = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
            substring = s[i:j]
        if (isPalindrome(substring)) and len(substring) > len(longest):
            longest = substring
    ```
    
2. Checking if a string is palindromic:
    
    ```python
    def isPalindrome(s):
        return s == s[::-1]
    ```
    
    Of course, to save time, you can just check half of the string, but $O(n/2) \thickapprox O(n)$, so yeah
    

The time complexity of this brute force attempt is $O(n^3)$, for details, please refer to [here](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters#heading-brute-force-attempt) as the methods are similar.

## Optimal Approach 1 (Dynamic Programming)

In the discussion, I mentioned solving the **subproblems**, so let’s write it out clearly:

### Idea

> A substring, `s[left:right + 1]` (substring from index ***left*** to ***right***, inclusive) is a palindrome if and only if `s[left + 1 : right]` (substring from index ***left + 1*** to ***right - 1***, inclusive) is palindrome and `s[left] == s[right]`.

Furthermore, there’ll be two base conditions:

1. `s[left:right + 1]` is a substring if `left == right`, one character strings are palindromic.
    
2. `s[left:right + 1]` is a substring if `s[left] == s[right]` and `right - left == 1`, two character strings are palindromic if both characters are the same
    

For other cases, we can apply the idea and build upon the base conditions.

### Examples

Here are two examples of the idea.

#### Example 1

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="Zv5dUZS"
  format="png"
  alt="Demonstrating the idea"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

#### Example 2

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="KWPPYmC"
  format="png"
  alt="Demonstrating the idea"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>
### Recursion Approach (Brute Force)

Let’s implement this idea using the recursion approach:

```python
def recurseIsPalindrome(s, left, right):
    if left == right:
        return True
    elif right - left == 1:
        return s[left] == s[right]
    else:
        return s[left] == s[right] and recurseIsPalindrome(s, left + 1, right - 1)

def solution1Bad():
    s = "ebababd"
    longest = ""
    for right in range(len(s)):
        for left in range(right + 1):
            if recurseIsPalindrome(s, left, right) and right - left + 1 > len(longest):
                longest = s[left : right + 1]

    return longest
```

So what about it? It’s basically reimplementing the initial brute force attempt using recursion, and it has the same time complexity of $O(n^3)$. However, we can build upon this by using Dynamic Programming: We store the previous results.

Notice that there have been some repetitions, e.g.,

1. `left = 1` and `right = 5`. To check if the substring `“babab”` is a palindrome, we examine substrings `“aba”` and `“b”`.
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="ZIxuaOT"
        format="png"
        alt="Demonstrating the recursion approach"
        width={400}
        height={400}
        />
    
2. `left = 2` and `right = 4`. To check if the substring `“bab”` is a palindrome, we examine substrings `“a”`.
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="pEd2xot"
        format="png"
        alt="Repetition"
        width={500}
        height={300}
        />
    

Notice the repetition? I’ve examined `“aba”` in (1), but I’m examining `“aba”` again in (2).

### Tabulation Method

This is where we will be optimizing, we will cache the results through the **tabulation method** from Dynamic Programming.

To achieve this, for every pair of `[left, right]` we came across, we will **cache the results** for a later lookup.

One way to do it is through hashmap, but since we know the exact size, array will be a better approach to reduce space usage:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
            ## The "cache"
            dp = [[False] * len(s) for _ in range(len(s))]
            res = ""
            for right in range(len(s)):
                for left in range(right + 1):
                    ## Reimplementing recurseIsPalindrome using cache
                    if right == left:
                        dp[right][left] = True
                    elif right == left + 1:
                        dp[right][left] = s[right] == s[left]
                    else:
                        dp[right][left] = dp[right - 1][left + 1] and s[right] == s[left]
                    if dp[right][left] and right - left + 1 > len(res):
                        res = s[left:right + 1]
            return res
```

Notice the similarity of this with the recursion approach? That’s the idea.

Here’s how the table will be filled up from the algorithm:

1. From our first condition, all **single character strings** (the diagonal) are palindrome, let’s fill them with True:
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="AA8Zkbz"
        format="png"
        alt="Tabulating from the diagonal"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        />
    
2. Next, we look at the second condition, two characters strings (the second diagonal), where `right == left + 1`, they are palindrome if `s[right] == s[left]`:
    
    *(somehow all are False)*
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="23bxNGB"
        format="png"
        alt="The second diagonal"
        width={500}
        height={400}
        />
    
3. Finally, we look at last condition, the box will be True if `dp[right -1][left + 1]`(that's it, the top right box) is True, and `s[right] == s[left]`:

    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="afvX4Wc"
        format="png"
        alt="Filling up the remaining"
        width={500}
        height={400}
        />
            
4. And so on…
    

Note that understanding the table might or might not help in understanding the algorithm, they’re just illustrations.

### Analysis

#### Time Complexity

As shown in the table, we are only filling up the bottom left portion of the table, hence it will be $O(n^2 / 2) \thickapprox O(n^2)$

**Of course, the easier way to see is that the for loop is only nested for one level**

#### Space Complexity

We have initialized a list / array of size $n \times n$ , hence the space complexity is $O(n^2)$ as well.

### Improving Space Complexity

It’s common in dynamic programming to improve the space complexity two **using only two rows**.

Notice from the diagrams that I’ll only be **referring to data from the previous row**? Thus, we will only store the data of **current and previous rows**.

To do this, we will **alternate between two rows**, we will use row 1 if it is in an odd iteration, and row 0 if it is in an even iteration.

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        dp = [[False] * len(s) for _ in range(2)]

        res = ""
        for right in range(len(s)):
            cur = right % 2 == 0
            for left in range(right + 1):
                if right == left:
                    dp[cur][left] = True
                elif right == left + 1:
                    dp[cur][left] = s[right] == s[left]
                else:
                    dp[cur][left] = dp[not cur][left + 1] and s[right] == s[left]
                if dp[cur][left] and right - left + 1 > len(res):
                    res = s[left:right + 1]
        return res
```

Basically, `not cur` refers to the previous row while `cur` is the current row.

That’s it, by using a simple trick, we could easily trim down our space complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and here’s the performance after optimization:

## Optimal Approach 2

On the other hand, the second approach is more trivial and straightforward. The idea is that instead of shrinking from outside in, we **expand inside out**.

### Idea

How does it work? We will treat every character in a string as a center of a palindrome, and find the largest palindrome from there.

To put it simply, rather than checking from two ends, we check **from the center**, and get the longest palindrome from this center.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="SNamqoy"
  format="png"
  alt="Demonstrating expanding from center out"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

However, our center might be two characters as well. In this case, we will assume the center to be in between two characters.

  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="eTeLZZG"
  format="png"
  alt="Demonstrating expanding from center out"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

### Implementation

The ideas can be implemented through the following steps:

1. Iterate through every character in the string.
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="EuTdsH9"
        format="png"
        alt="Iterating"
        width={600}
        height={300}
        />
            
2. Expand from the point:
    
    1. Every character is a center
        
        <ImgurImage
            size="large thumbnail"
            imgurId="rl1YZSp"
            format="png"
            alt="Showing the center"
            width={600}
            height={300}
            />
        
    2. The point between the current character and the next character is a center
        
        <ImgurImage
            size="large thumbnail"
            imgurId="0LAP979"
            format="png"
            alt="Center in between"
            width={600}
            height={300}
            />
        
3. Compare and get the longest substring from 2(a) and 2(b)
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="lXs01aC"
        format="png"
        alt="Comparison"
        width={600}
        height={300}
        />
            

However, it’ll be difficult to represent the concept of ***center between the characters***, hence, left & right pointers will be used. They will be implemented slightly differently:

1. For scenario 2(a) - `left = center = right`
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="7kMPFuw"
        format="png"
        alt="left and right pointers"
        width={600}
        height={300}
        />
    
2. For scenario 2(b) - `left = right of center` and `right = left of center`
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="pokvRzO"
        format="png"
        alt="Left and right pointers"
        width={600}
        height={300}
        />
    
    You must be wondering if I wrote it wrongly, no, in fact I didn’t.
    
    This is to ensure that the initial string of palindrome, `s[left: right + 1] == “”`, and not `“dd”` as the initial pair of characters may not always be palindromic, e.g., `“db”`.
    

And finally, here’s the codes

```python
def expandFromCenter(s, left, right):
    leftP, rightP = left, right
    # Making sure that it's still within the boundary
    while leftP > 0 and rightP < len(s) - 1 and s[leftP - 1] == s[rightP + 1]:
        leftP -= 1
        rightP += 1
    return rightP - leftP

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        for center in range(len(s)):
            onePointCenter = expandFromCenter(s, center, center)
            twoPointCenter = expandFromCenter(s, center + 1, center)
            best = max(onePointCenter, twoPointCenter)
            if best + 1 > len(res):
                isTwoPoint = best % 2 == 1
                leftEnd = center - best // 2
                rightEnd = center + best // 2 + isTwoPoint
                res = s[leftEnd:rightEnd + 1]
        return res
```

I believe the only doubt here is on the `isTwoPoint`.

So let’s look back at both scenarios, and notice that scenario (1) will always result in even best while scenario (2) will result in odd best. (`best = length - 1 = right - left`)

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="Kv3mAJI"
  format="png"
  alt="Example"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Hence, for scenario (1), the `leftEnd` and `rightEnd` is simply $center \pm best / 2$.

(*as best / 2 is the distance from the center to the end*)

However, it’s a bit tricky for scenario (2). Note the distance from ***center*** to left and the right end is `best / 2 + 1` since `best` is odd, and we are doing floor division. Besides, from the codes, our `center` is always the left character of the ***center point***. Thus, the `leftEnd` remains `center - best / 2`.

*(without the need of + 1, as it's already on the left side)*

### Analysis

#### Time Complexity

`expandFromCenter` operation is O(n), and iterating the string is $O(n)$. Since we do `expandFromCenter` in every iteration, the resulting time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

#### Space Complexity

As we only store pointers, it can be said that space complexity is $O(1)$.

Of course, the improvement is provided on the assumption that the result `res` is not taken into account, otherwise, it will remain the same as O(n) as `res` can have the same length as `s`.

Oh and here's the performance on Leetcode using this approach:

## Last Words

This problem represents a typical dynamic **programming** style problem. Hence, for those who have not learned about DP, solution 1 might be more challenging. Nonetheless, solution 2 should be friendly to most.

Lastly, there’s also a more advanced and very specific $O(n)$ algorithm that solves this particular problem.
