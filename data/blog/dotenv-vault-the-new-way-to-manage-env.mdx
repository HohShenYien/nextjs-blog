<TOCInline toc={props.toc} />

Sharing `.env` values **manually** through **copy-pasting** seems to still be the most common approach in the software industry. However, I thought we've always been boasting about our technological prowess, but why are we stuck with this old-school tradition?

In this article, I will be sharing a somewhat _opinionated_ tool, **dotenv-vault** that modernizes the way we handle `.env` files!

As a bonus, I'll also show you how it can simplify your docker deployment process.

## What's Wrong with Manual Sharing?

While sharing .env through chats **doesn't necessarily lead to disaster**, but it does come with some **unpleasant effects**.

PS: I will not consider security here. _(not that it's insignificant, but I doubt that multimillion project owner still doing it)_

### Messy

Here are some scenarios

1. You asked someone for a secret, they sent you through DM's or Telegram.
2. Someone updated a feature to include a new secret, they sent them to a group
3. Your team leader thought the secret might better live in the documentation  
   _PS: Only some_
4. During onboarding, the secrets were sent to you through an email
5. etc.

So where can you find secret A? Telegram? Slack? Direct Message? Group Message? Which Group?

The secrets are **scattered everywhere**!

Of course, it's not the end of the day, you can always ask another developer for the secrets.

_Just that we developers don't like to ask people sometimes._

### Error-prone

<ImgurImage

  height={300}
/>

What if you accidentally **deleted a secret** from staging/production while editing the file? Or what if you edited the **wrong variable**? What if you **deleted a character** while scrolling down?

Maybe it wasn't noticeable right away as .env are cached, but the production might go down during the next deployment!

As long as edits happen in terminals, it's **prone to errors**, especially when juniors or interns who aren't familiar with bash get access to it. _(I believe the readers are not one of these)_

_PS: From one of my experiences, we update the production/staging .env using ssh, and that's my assumption here._

---

Again, these two reasons aren't huge enough issues, but they make us less happy at times. Also, it's always a good reason to progress forward, isn't it?

In the worst-case scenario, it may even lead to huge mistakes, such as deleting important env secrets while updating production `.env`, and breaking the production.

## Env Vault

Introducing `.env` secrets manager, [dotenv-vault](https://www.dotenv.org/).

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="MMxcAVK"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of dotenv website"
  width={600}
  height={600}
/>

In short, it's like Git, but for `.env` files.

It's pretty intuitive for most programmers out there, with operations involving only `pull`, `push`, and `build` most of the time.

### Benefits

Clearly, when it comes to benefits, it must solve the aforementioned issues. Let's see how `dotenv-vault` does it

#### Clean

Even with just a quick peek at the screenshot above, you can already see how the secrets will be **kept centralized**.

The best part about this is that if you're building with microservices or having multiple projects, then these secrets **can be accessed by all of them**, without repetition! _Say bye to copy pasting values across multiple projects._

Every update will be **made directly to the vault**, so everyone can access all updated values easily. Beyond that, it also offers **different environments** to separate the secrets of our environments, so it does cater to most of our needs.

#### Safety

_This is not about security, but corresponds to error prevention._

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="AIZE5lC"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of editing secret on dotenv"
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>

Remember how I commented on the insecurity of editing file from the terminal? What if you can only **edit one variable at one time**? While carelessness can still lead to mistakes, the **possibility of errors will be minimized now**.

#### Simplicity

How many commands do we need to remember? **2**, for most cases.

```bash
npx dotenv-vault pull [development/staging/production] # to pull in new changes
npx dotenv-vault push # to push changes from local
```

#### Security

I'm no security expert here, but according to the [docs](https://www.dotenv.org/security/), they do look pretty secure! All **decrypted values exist only in memory** and are flushed after using it.

#### Others

Unfortunately, the paid version is required to access more features of dotenv-vault. Nonetheless, **$5 per month per user** seems rather affordable for companies out there.

_You probably don't need dotenv-vault for your personal projects anyways, who are you sending your secrets to?_

Here are some cool features I find on [paid version](https://www.dotenv.org/pricing/):

1. **Version history**, similar to Git, allows you to rollback and examine changes at the individual level
2. **Slack notification**, who wouldn't want to be notified when someone changes the secrets?
3. **User Access Controls**, it's probably best to just let the DevOps guys manage these keys. Or perhaps the seniors.

Of course, these are some nice additions, dotenv-vault is totally amazing in its free version anyways.

### What about Config Server?

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="GdfkECf"
  format="png"
  alt="Spring Boot"
  width={400}
  height={300}
/>

If you come from a **Spring Boot** background, you might find this surprisingly similar to [config server](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cloud-configuration)! Nevertheless, config servers **aren't the convention** for JavaScript & Python projects, so yeah.

There are more differences, but I'd stop here since it's not the purpose of this article. You can read more about it [here](https://dev.to/gregorygaines/stop-using-env-files-now-kp0).

## Project Setup

To demo the usage of `dotenv-vault`, I'll be using a Next.js project. More specifically, I'll be using my next-power-starter template, to get started, simply run

```bash
yarn create next-app dotenv-hello-world -e https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter
```

_Not self-promotion, just simply because it's an empty project on my computer that I can use directly._

## Usage

1. Sign Up  
   Well, I guess you know how to do that. Here's the [link](https://vault.dotenv.org/account/signup).
2. Create a new vault  
    The vault is required to **link the project with dotenv-vault server**. This step is required for new projects.

   ```bash
   npx dotenv-vault new
   ```

   <ImgurImage
     size="full"
     imgurId="EkdaTu0"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of my terminal"
     width={800}
     height={300}
   />

   After pressing `y`, your browser will launch into a page like this

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="bIOEXR0"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of new project in dotenv"
     width={600}
     height={400}
   />

   After clicking next, you will notice that a new file, `.env.vault` is added to your project!

   <ImgurImage
     size="full"
     imgurId="7YU1mjW"
     format="png"
     alt="screenshot of my .env.vault"
     width={800}
     height={400}
   />

   The value there will **point to the remote project on dotenv**. _(doesn't it sound like Git?)_  
    This `DOTENV_VAULT` is not a secret, it's just like the github project link, nothing special about it. Therefore it's okay to be shown.

3. Login from terminal  
    The next step will require us to prove that we're **a member of the project** before we can access the secrets.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="EbJ4ajx"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of step2 in project setup"
     width={600}
     height={500}
   />

   ```bash
   npx dotenv-vault login
   ```

   <ImgurImage
     size="full"
     imgurId="oVwwtsr"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of my terminal to login dotenv"
     width={800}
     height={400}
   />

   You'll either be logged in already like below, or you'll need to login in dotenv.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="i2DRGED"
     format="png"
     alt="Logging in from dotenv"
     width={500}
     height={600}
   />

   Going back to the project, you should see a new file, `.env.me`. This file is like the auth token that **proves that you can access the project**. Therefore, if you share the file, then others can also access the secrets without having to login again.

   <ImgurImage
     size="full"
     imgurId="PGACzHM"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of my edited .env.me"
     width={700}
     height={500}
   />

   PS: This file is like the top secret, don't share it!

4. Add some secrets  
    Next, let's head back to your [dashboard](https://vault.dotenv.org/ui). You should see your project being listed there.

   Clicking into the project, you should see something like

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="71tLJ1o"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of dotenv-hello-world"
     width={600}
     height={400}
   />

   Since we have already setup, just click the _click here._

   Next, we can add a secret, say NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME and MY_NAME.

   _PS: The prefix NEXT_PUBLIC... means that it can be used in the client, while other environmental variables can only be accessed in the server. Read more about it in the_ [_docs_](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables)_._

   <ImgurImage
     size="medium thumbnail"
     imgurId="uAUtWWy"
     format="png"
     alt="Adding new secret"
     width={400}
     height={400}
   />

   It should look like this in the end.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="VwgYtiC"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of secrets on dotenv"
     width={600}
     height={400}
   />

   Note that the environment is `development`

5. Pull from local  
    Now that we've set it up in `dotenv-vault`, we can now download it to our local project. Let's run

   ```bash
   npx dotenv-vault pull development # depends on the environment you want to pull
   ```

   and voila, the image is now in your project!

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="8qwE7kz"
     format="png"
     alt="screenshot of downloaded .env"
     width={600}
     height={400}
   />

6. Push from local  
    Maybe you'd prefer to update the `.env` and publish it on `dotenv`? Let's do it

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="jyTXhoN"
     format="png"
     alt="Added new variables in .env"
     width={600}
     height={400}
   />

   I've added a new variable, `MY_EMAIL` and modified `MY_NAME` to my full name. Let's push it

   ```bash
   npx dotenv-vault push development # depends on the environment you want to push to
   ```

   Checking it on the `dotenv-vault`, you should see the new keys appearing there

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="FFUQ7rX"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of updated value from dotenv"
     width={600}
     height={500}
   />

### Checking the environmental variable in project

Let's use the variables from the Next.js project. Open up the page, `app/page.tsx`

_Yes, this project uses the app directory, you can read more about it_ [_here_](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/the-nextjs-13-app-directory-and-server-components)_._

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
...
export default function Home() {
  // I can do this because this is a server component
  const myName = process.env.MY_NAME;
  ...
              <p className="text-slate-600">
                The template which balances flexibility and simplicity
              </p>
              <p className="font-sm text-slate-600">By {myName}</p>
  ...
```

Spin up the development server,

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can now find the variable shown up _(The By Hoh Shen Yien)_

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="BkxqvVd"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of variable showing in project"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

## Bonus: Deployment with Docker

Finally, let's look at how we can deploy the project with docker.

### Production Environment

Let's first push our `.env` to production,

1. `.env.production`  
   Let's create a new `.env.production` file which will be pushed to production

   ```bash
   cp .env .env.production
   ```

   Before we push, we will also need to edit the first line, which indicates the environment

   ```plaintext
   # production@v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="dotenv-hello-world"
   MY_NAME="Hoh Shen Yien"
   MY_EMAIL="hohshenyien@gmail.com"
   ```

2. Pushing to dotenv

   ```bash
   npx dotenv-vault push production
   ```

You should see the secrets appearing on `remote dotenv`, in the production environment.

### Setting up Docker

You can install the Docker [here](https://www.docker.com/) if you haven't already.

Let's add a Dockerfile, here's the starting file from [Nextjs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile)

Copy the entire content, and paste it into `/Dockerfile`.

Finally, also update `/next.config.js` to use the "standalone" output type

```typescript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone',
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

### Setting up Next.js

To deploy on Docker, we'll need to add a new dependency,

```bash
yarn add dotenv-vault-core
```

You'll need this line before you can access the environmental variables.

_It will download the .env to the server during execution_

```typescript
require('dotenv-vault-core').config()
```

Since there's technically no `index.js` file that will be called on every page _(if just page, then it can lie in_ `app/layout.tsx`_, but they won't be available in API routes)_ & API.

Hence, I'll create a `env.ts` file that contains all environmental variables

```typescript
// src/utils/configs/env.ts
require('dotenv-vault-core').config()

export const MY_NAME = process.env.MY_NAME
```

And to access these variables, just **import them**! Simple and straightforward.

### Retrieving Production Key

Finally, we will need to pass the **production vault key** for `dotenv` to download the `.env` file. To retrieve the key, you can run

```bash
npx dotenv-vault keys production
```

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="Fmf7BSj"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of running the command"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

You'll get the production key in the next line. Copy it, we'll use it to run the docker image.

_PS: the key should look like_ `dotenv://key_..../.env.vault?environment=production`

### Building Docker Image

Finally, just build the docker image as usual

```bash
docker build -t docker-next .
```

and to test it locally on localhost:8080 _(Because 3000 is occupied by the running Next.js project earlier)_

```bash
docker run -e DOTENV_KEY="your_key_here" --rm -it -p 8080:3000 --init docker-next
```

And that's it. You have a perfectly working Docker image.

You can check out their [documentation](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/integrations/docker/express.html) for more details.

## Conclusion

Migrating to `dotenv-vault` is relatively simple, and its benefits are quite significant.

I **used it once and truly enjoyed it**, so perhaps you should try it too!

**Disclaimer**: I am not sure how will `dotenv` and Docker work in a serverless environment (Vercel), maybe it'll retrieve it for every different server?
