Leetcode problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i<super>th</super></code> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

### **Example 1:**

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="Mz306Dp"
  format="jpg"
  alt="Container of water"
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>


```plaintext
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

### **Example 2:**

```plaintext
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

### **Constraints:**

* `n == height.length`
    
* <p><code>2 \<\= n \<\= 10<super>5</super></code></p>
    
* <p><code>0 \<\= height[i] \<\= 10<super>4</super></code></p>

### Note

The area is **bound by the smaller height of the two lines**. (I hope it's logical to you ðŸ˜Œ)

## Discussion

### Concepts

* **Two pointers** - Notice that there's a left and a right in this problem? Yupp, usually when there's a **left** and a **right**, two pointers can be used. Two pointers is a general algorithm that helps to solve the problem by **keeping track** and **moving a left & a right pointers repetitively**.
    
* **Greedy Algorithm** - This involves how the two pointers are moving. Basically, we will always **choose the taller line**. Greedy here refers to taking the current tallest (taller of the two) and **assuming it's the best now,** instead of searching for the tallest of all. Details will be discussed in the idea section.
    

### Brute Force Attempt

I'll skip the codes, but it'll be almost identical to the brute force from the [previous problem](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters#heading-brute-force-attempt).

The brute force here will involve computing the area of every pair of lines, and getting the maximum of them.

The complexity of brute force will be **\\(O(n^2)\\)** from the iteration of every pair (*due to nested loop*) as area calculation is only **\\(O(1)\\)**.

## Optimal Approach

### Idea

The optimal approach (**greedy algorithm**) involves moving the two pointers from **outside in**.

We will start our two pointers from leftmost and rightmost.

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="Qa1ZdNG"
  format="png"
  alt="Two pointer approach"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>


Why? Well, as we know, `area = width * height`. Thus, the height and width are what we are trying to **maximize** here. So I start from the maximum width and try to get the best height along the way.

While moving, we will compute the area and compare for the maximum in every iteration.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="HkOTaxm"
  format="png"
  alt="Calculating the area of water"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>


```python
def calculateArea(heights, left, right):
    return min(heights[left], heights[right]) * (right - left)
```

Next question is, how do we decide whether we move `leftPointer` or `rightPointer`?

As I said, we try to maximize the width and height. Now that we're at maximum width, we will search for the **best height**. How? We move the pointer with **lower height.**

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="oQu6c4o"
  format="png"
  alt="Right pointer is shorter"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="oQu6c4o"
  format="png"
  alt="Moving the right pointer"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>


That's it! We will repeat this and we will get the greatest height in the end.

### Discussion

Before we begin, here's some notation

`bestLeft, bestRight` = the lines where the maximal area, `maximalArea` lies in

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="x3inbcz"
  format="png"
  alt="Calculating the new max area"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>


Just an additional discussion section in case you have some questions that I had:

1. Why don't we go **inside out** but outside in?
    
    Well, there's only one problem with this, **where do we start**?  
    To get the maximum area, we must ensure that our `leftPointer` will eventually reach `bestLeft` and the same for our `bestRight`.
    
    Say we decided to start from center
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="qOgS5EX"
        format="png"
        alt="Inside out doesn't work"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        />

    
    By expanding our `leftPointer` left, it'll never reach `bestLeft`, hence failing the algorithm.
    
2. Why does this work?
    
    Let's ask it the other way around, ***why does this not work?*** (proof by contradiction)
    
    Using our greedy algorithm, there's one thing for sure, either our `leftPointer` will eventually touch `bestLeft` or `rightPointer` will eventually touch `bestRight`.

    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="9t9YcoJ"
        format="png"
        alt="Outside In works"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        />
    
    Notice that `leftPointer` always moves `width - steps by rightPointer` before they meet up.
    
    So let's say our `rightPointer` is already at `bestRight`, while our `leftPointer` has not touched `bestLeft` yet.
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="seZeUoK"
        format="png"
        alt="Out in can find the tallest"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        />

    
    So in what scenario our `leftPointer` doesn't touch `bestLeft`? When `rightPointer` reaches `bestLeft`, that is, we need to move our `rightPointer` from `bestRight`.
    
    And when are we moving our `rightPointer`? When `leftPointer > rightPointer`, or `leftPointer > bestRight`.

    <ImgurImage
        size="large thumbnail"
        imgurId="U5rlUXo"
        format="png"
        alt="Finding the best left"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        />

    
    However, if that is the case, there are contradictions here:
    
    1. if `bestRight <= bestLeft`,
        
        $Area = bestRight * width$ (since `bestRight` is the shorter of two)
        
        <ImgurImage
            size="large thumbnail"
            imgurId="ZBa9URG"
            format="png"
            alt="Maximal area?"
            width={500}
            height={500}
            />

        
        and since `leftPointer` is on the left of `bestLeft`, the width here is larger. This means that the area here is larger than `maximalArea`.  
        
    2. if `bestRight > bestLeft`,
        
        $Area = bestLeft * width$

        <ImgurImage
            size="large thumbnail"
            imgurId="Y4XADhI"
            format="png"
            alt="Found the best"
            width={500}
            height={500}
            />

        
        and since `leftPointer > bestRight > bestLeft`, doesn't this mean that the area from `leftPointer` and `bestRight` is bigger than `maximalArea`?
        
    
    Thus, the contradiction shows that the scenario will not happen, i.e., `leftPointer` will always reach `leftBest` and `rightPointer` will always reach `rightBest`.

    Of course, there are many more amazing explanations out [there](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/solutions/?q=contra&orderBy=hot), do check them out if you're not convinced by this! (at least I'm convinced by this)
    

### Codes

```python
def calculateArea(heights, left, right):
    return min(heights[left], heights[right]) * (right - left)

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        curMax = 0
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        while left < right:
            curMax = max(curMax, calculateArea(height, left, right))
            ## It's the same using < or <=
            if height[left] <= height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
                
        return curMax
```

Notice I mentioned that it doesn't matter using &lt; or &lt;=, this is because if `leftPointer == rightPointer`,

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="2Y5P8ZP"
  format="png"
  alt="The best area"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="PNKZRDR"
  format="png"
  alt="Found the best area"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>


Regardless of which pointer you move, the resulting area will be smaller. (*width lower, but same height*)

## Analysis

### Time Complexity

As we will only go through the entire array once (from moving `leftPointer` and `rightPointer`) and calculating the area once for each position, the time complexity will be `O(n)`

*As mentioned previously,* `calculateArea` *is `O(1)`*

### Space Complexity

`O(1)` space, as space is only allocated to pointers.

## Last Words

While this problem is not too difficult in terms of algorithm, I find the proof by contradiction to be rather interesting and widened my horizon! ðŸ¤©
