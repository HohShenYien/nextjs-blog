<TOCInline toc={props.toc} />

In this part, you are finally going to learn about **deploying the Next.js app** we have built so far online! I will also show you how to set up a **PostgreSQL database** online and deploy our **Prisma Schema** there.

There are many ways you can deploy it, and over here, I'm just showing 2 of the methods to deploy it. The first one is the easier, which is deploying on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the second will be slightly more difficult using **Docker** on [Render](https://render.com).

**Note**: _we usually just need to set up deployment once, and it'll be automatic later._

If you didn't follow along for the past parts, check out the complete codes since the last part [here](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part8-like-follow).

## PostgreSQL Database

**Note**: Now you can use Vercel's own [PostgreSQL database](https://vercel.com/guides/using-databases-with-vercel) for it.

Before we can deploy our Next.js, we will first take a detour to set up a PostgreSQL database first.

Why? Because our Next.js app is a **full-stack** web application that has a backend part that needs to **communicate with a database**. Without the database, our website is as good as nothing since it can't even handle authentication!

Again, there are many available PostgreSQL services online that you can use, but particularly I'm looking for a free and quick-to-setup database. After researching, I've decided to go for [Elephant SQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="b5ufyCl"
  format="png"
  alt="Elephant SQL"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

The most important part that attracted me is its **free plan**. Nevertheless, even if you decided to pick other options, the experience should be similar too.

_I mean I'm not going to pay for a database for an article, right?_

**Note**: _Elephant SQL has a limit of 5 concurrent sessions on free plan, so it might cause some hiccups on the actual apps later._

### Creating an Instance

After signing up, you can create a new **instance**, which is a PostgreSQL service. Next, we just need to fill up some basic info about names and things. Feel free to name it however you like of course.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="ICwaILj"
  format="png"
  alt="Creating an instance in Elephant SQL"
  width={700}
  height={500}
/>

When it comes to database / server location, we should always pick a location that's the **nearest** to our customers. Thus, I selected **Hong Kong** as I'm from Asia, and Hong Kong is the nearest option to my location.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="Hsp4nZC"
  format="png"
  alt="Selecting data center"
  width={700}
  height={400}
/>

The next two parts are just confirmation and trivial. So there we are, a functional PostgreSQL database for our use.

### Database Credential

Back to the PostgreSQL dashboard, you can select the instance that you set-up just now _(or be redirected there after creating one)_

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="klHqFGk"
  format="png"
  alt="Viewing all instances"
  width={800}
  height={400}
/>

Opening it up, you should see a list of important information

_You wouldn't want to show the details to others, else they can access your database easily._

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="20Duo4d"
  format="png"
  alt="Database Details"
  width={700}
  height={500}
/>

Among all, the only detail that is of our interest is the **URL**. It'll be used to set `DATABASE_URL` for our environmental variables in `.env`. **Copy the URL** because we will need it later.

### Deploying Prisma & Seeding

Now that you have the URL, let's head back to our codes. Open up your `.env` file, and replace your DATABASE_URL with the URL you have copied.

_PS: Remember to wrap them in quotes because they are string_

_PS2: I usually like to just comment the variable so that I can switch easily between local and remote database._

```plaintext
# .env
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/instanext";
DATABASE_URL="the_url_you_have_copied"
```

Finally, let's deploy our Prisma schema over the database. Let's run `migrate deploy`

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

There shouldn't have any problem unless your `DATABASE_URL` is misconfigured. At this point, you can either just **trust that it works**, or if you're a paranoia like me, connect to the database using clients like my favorite [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

_You can connect to it easily using the database details we got earlier_

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="Ehh5Xic"
  format="png"
  alt="Browsing Postgres tables"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

I checked that it's been connected successfully. You might also want to run **seeding** a few times to fill the database with some values.

_I ran a few times to get more values_

```bash
yarn seed
```

And you're done with the database now!

## Option 1: Vercel

_If you haven't already known, Next.js is created by_ [_Vercel_](https://vercel.com)_._

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="SeLwpJv"
  format="png"
  alt="Vercel Landing page"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

Vercel is a **hosting platform** that lets you host your Node projects _(mainly frontend frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte Kit)_. Again, the best part about Vercel is that it offers a **free plan** (Hobby).

### Setting Up Build Script

As we are building a fullstack application using **Prisma** here, we need do a little minor update to the build script. Otherwise, when the project is being built, it will encounter **Type Error** as Prisma Types are **absent**.

Let's head back to our `package.json`, we will update the `build` script there to first generate the Prisma types with `prisma generate` before running `next build`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    // update this line
    "build": "prisma generate && next build",
...
```

after finishing, remember to **push the codes** back to `main` branch so that Vercel can detect the updated script later.

### Getting Started

It's very simple to set it up, just register an account with it. I'd recommend you to sign up with your **GitHub** account as we are going to connect Vercel to your GitHub later. _(It makes your life a little easier, since you're going to connect to it anyways)_

You should get to this page after signing up.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="zl5vsB8"
  format="png"
  alt="Creating new service on Vercel"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

Over here, it'll probably prompt you to **install Vercel** on your GitHub, just install it so that it can connect to your repo and set up some commit hooks on your selected repository.

_PS: The commit hooks will notify Vercel to deploy the project whenever there's new commit to the project_

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="YXAWWk9"
  format="png"
  alt="Installing Vercel on GitHub"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Then, you can select either all repositories, or specific repositories. Over here, I've only selected my [insta-next](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/main) repository. It's totally up to you which option to select.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="pv3sVTa"
  format="png"
  alt="Selecting specific repositories for deployment"
  width={500}
  height={600}
/>

You should see a repository there after confirming the access. **Import** the insta-next repo.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="r4RJZGX"
  format="png"
  alt="Importing Git repository into Vercel"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

### Configurations

You can now see some configurations there. Normally, the defaults will work fine.

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="9AbUUGf"
  format="png"
  alt="Configuring Vercel Project"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

However, since we made some changes to our build script, we will **override** the build commands to use `npm run build` to run the build script we wrote. (_Just in case Vercel uses_ `next build` _instead of_ `npm run build`)

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="togLUbx"
  format="png"
  alt="Build command settings"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Finally, scroll down and expand the **Environment Variables**.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="kWuTFa7"
  format="png"
  alt="Setting Environment Variables on Vercel"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

You should add both `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variables. Just copy the variables from your `.env` file. In the end, the table below should consist of two rows

### Deployment

After completing the configurations, we are done with everything. Click the **DEPLOY** button now.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="UqQXReO"
  format="png"
  alt="Deploy button"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

It should now begin to build, sit back and take a sip of water while waiting.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="ofBXWMw"
  format="png"
  alt="Vercel deployment in progress"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

After a while, it's done!

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="fLXeopS"
  format="png"
  alt="Successful Deployment"
  width={700}
  height={400}
/>

You can now click the domains given there and launch the app!

It's `https://insta-next-alpha.vercel.app` for me, so probably something else for you.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="FOvdH8H"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of InstaNext on Vercel"
  width={700}
  height={500}
/>

Awesome!

_PS: However, you might notice some places being a little off, where posts won't load at the front page, that's due to the database's limitation where there can be only 5 active connections, leave it a while and it'll show up fine later._

Note that we **don't need to manually deploy** anymore unless you're changing the build process. Vercel has set up a **deploy hook** on our repo, so whenever there's a new commit, the project will be redeployed again.

## Docker

Compared to using Vercel, Docker will be a harder way because it requires you to know how Docker works.

### Dockerfile

Luckily for us, Next.js has provided a [Dockerfile script](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env/docker/production/Dockerfile) that we can use. Let's copy over to our project. For convention, we will put it in `/docker/Dockerfile`.

The explanation of what it does is a bit beyond the scope. Nevertheless, it basically builds the Next.js app, export and serve it.

```plaintext
# /docker/Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# 1. Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
# Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
RUN \
  if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \
  elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \
  elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm i; \
  else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
  fi


# 2. Rebuild the source code only when needed
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .

RUN yarn build

# 3. Production image, copy all the files and run next
FROM base AS runner
ARG DATABASE_URL
ARG NEXTAUTH_SECRET
WORKDIR /app

ENV NODE_ENV=production

RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
# https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static


USER nextjs

EXPOSE 3000

ENV PORT 3000

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

_PS: Dockerfile will be sufficient for our use case here, alternatively, you might want to use their_ [_docker-compose.yml_](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env/docker/production/docker-compose.yml) _if you're using docker compose_

_PS2: I've removed the line_ `COPY .env.production.sample .env.production` _since we are not using any .env file here, rather we use environment variables._

_PS3: The environment variables will be passed in the form of_ [_build-arg_](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#build-arg)_, basically means that they'll be passed to the docker container from the commandline, so I added_ `ARG DATABASE_URL` _and_ `ARG NEXTAUTH_SECRET` _so that these variables will be retrieved and used in the images._

One minor change is that the Next.js **output mode** should be updated to `"standalone"` which is the mode suitable for Docker deployment. This can be updated from `next.config.js`.

_Check out their_ [_docs_](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing) _for the explanation if you're curious._

```typescript
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  output: 'standalone', // this is required for Docker
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

And everything is done with the codes, **commit and push** the changes.

### Render

For docker, I've selected [Render](https://render.com/) host it.

Like Vercel, it's a hosting platform, but it can host a lot more types of services. Also, it provides free hosting service, that's why I used it.

_I also had some good experience deploying there, so yeah._

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="9ep307w"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of Render landing page"
  width={700}
  height={500}
/>

### Getting Started

Just sign up for an account, and once you're done, you should see the **dashboard**.

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="Z0znCSS"
  format="png"
  alt="Render Dashboard"
  width={800}
  height={600}
/>

Hover over the **New** button on the top right, and select the **Web Service**, it's what we're going to host. _(Or just click on the New Web Service, it's the same, no idea why I took an extra step there...)_

Next, you should see GitHub connection on the right, I had an account prior to this, so I need to connect manually here.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="sB0KhHl"
  format="png"
  alt="Connecting GitHub to Render"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

Then, just like Vercel part, I selected `insta-next` repo.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="KFKinX8"
  format="png"
  alt="Installing Render on GitHub"
  width={400}
  height={600}
/>

After installation, you should see the repo showing in the list, click **Connect**

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="jHxhG3d"
  format="png"
  alt="Selecting a repository from Render dashboard"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

### Configuration

After connecting, you should see a list of configurations. I named it `insta-next` and other things there can be kept as they are.

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="jK6uYZ9"
  format="png"
  alt="Setting up deployment options on Render"
  width={800}
  height={700}
/>

Since we are using docker here, update the **Runtime** to **Docker**

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="Nv1p1dW"
  format="png"
  alt="Docker Runtime"
  width={700}
  height={400}
/>

Besides, we will also use the free plan for this project.

Next, scroll all the way down to find this **advanced** option, click to open it.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="KYb6WzU"
  format="png"
  alt="Advanced options"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

The first option will be **Environment Variable**, let's set both `DATABASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` properly. They should look like this at the end

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="lcSVplp"
  format="png"
  alt="Setting environment variables on Render"
  width={800}
  height={500}
/>

The next option is the **Dockerfile Path**. Remember that we put them in `./docker/Dockerfile`? Write it down.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="fGFyBRy"
  format="png"
  alt="Dockerfile Path"
  width={800}
  height={500}
/>

### Deployment

And that's basically it! Scroll all the way down, and press **Create Web Service**. The deployment will begin now.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="aKvkm1b"
  format="png"
  alt="Deployment Button"
  width={400}
  height={400}
/>

Sit back and relax. Take a sip of water while waiting for it to build.

_PS: It'll probably take up to 10 mins, so might as well browse some Reddits..._

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="unCP3g0"
  format="png"
  alt="Deployment in action"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

After a while, the deployment will be successful!

_Yes, I fixed some Dockerfile stuffs in between, that's why the commit changed._

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="Qii55dQ"
  format="png"
  alt="Successful Deployment"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

You can now check out the website on the link above, it's `https://insta-next.onrender.com` for me.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="oJlcloE"
  format="png"
  alt="Link to deployment website"
  width={600}
  height={400}
/>

And once again, everything is working fine!

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="NKbyJXW"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of InstaNext deployed on Render"
  width={700}
  height={500}
/>

Note that we **don't need to manually deploy the project** on Render anymore unless you're changing the build process. Render has set up a deploy hook that will be triggered whenever there's a new commit to `main` branch, so the project will be redeployed with every new commit.

_Render might be a bit slower in performance because unlike Vercel, the web service will be placed to sleep while inactive. Refer_ [_Render's docs_](https://render.com/docs/free#free-web-services)_._

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="mL1orbR"
  format="png"
  alt="Render might be slow in free"
  width={800}
  height={500}
/>

## Summary

In this part, you have successfully deployed the Next.js app that we built online. I have shown you two methods here, using **Vercel** and **Docker**.

Deploying on Vercel is pretty much **trivial** aside from the need of setting up the Environment variables.

Meanwhile, deploying using Docker might be **harder** depending on your experience with Docker. For example, if you didn't know about [ARG](https://vsupalov.com/docker-arg-env-variable-guide/), you might be having a hard time getting the **environment variables** to work even with the Dockerfile template.

Nevertheless, Render's UI is quite intuitive, so after creating the Dockerfile, the deployment process should be **smooth**.

In addition, I've also shown you how to deploy your **Prisma schema** to a remote database on Elephant SQL.

I hope you have learned a few things here today! Feel free to check out the complete codes for this part on [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part9-deployment).

_By now, I have completed all the basic features of InstaNext, so even I don't know what I will write for the upcoming parts, do stay tuned for them!_
