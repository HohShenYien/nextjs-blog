Leetcode problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`Â and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to* `target`.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

### Example 2:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

## Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Constraints:

* <p><code>2 \<\= nums.length \<\= 10<sup>4</sup></code></p>
    
* <p><code>-10<sup>9</sup> \<\= nums[i] \<\= 10<sup>9</sup></code></p>
    
* <p><code>-10<sup>9</sup> \<\= target \<\= 10<sup>9</sup></code></p>
    
* **Only one valid answer exists.**
    

## Discussion

### Concepts

* **Hashmap** - Notice that we are essentially **searching** for a pair of numbers, and since we don't want to **reiterate the whole array** for the other pair of every number, we will store the numbers we come across in a hashmap to optimize lookup time.
    

### Brute Force Attempt

We are basically going to **iterate through every pair** of numbers to find the pair that adds up to the `target`.

```python
def bruteForce(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

That's it.

The number of iterations will be

$$n + (n - 1) + (n-2) + \dots + 1 \\\\ = \sum^{x=n}_{1}x \\\\ = \frac{n ^ 2 + n}{2} \\\\ = O(n^2)$$

So the time complexity is $O(n^2)$

## Optimal Approach

### Idea

Rather than summing them up, **subtraction** is the way to go.

Let's look at **Example 1** again

```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
```

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="2If5tB2"
  format="jpg"
  alt="Visualization of the algorithm"
  width={500}
  height={500}
/>

So, the idea is to find the **other pair** for every number. To avoid repetition, we will store every number in a **hashmap**.

Hence, this is the step:

1. For every number, we check if its pair exists in `hashmap`.
    
2. If yes, we are done.
    
3. If not, we will store the number and the index into our `hashmap`
    
4. Repeat for the next number.
    

### Codes

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hashmap = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            diff = target - nums[i]
            if diff in hashmap:
                return [hashmap[diff], i]
            hashmap[nums[i]] = i
```

## Analysis

### Time Complexity

Looking at the codes, we are only **iterating through the array once**, hence, the time complexity is \\(O(n)\\)

### Space Complexity

Likewise, we can see that we are storing every number in our `hashmap` at worst case, hence the space complexity is \\(O(n)\\) as well.

## Last Words

This is arguably one of the easiest (if not the easiest) problems on Leetcode and many people's first problems.

While it is simple, it presented a very good point on optimization through hashmap. It's a simple tradeoff between space and time complexity where we achieve a **balance between time and space complexity**.
