_I noticed that my previous_ [_Mantine + Tailwind article_](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/insta-next-more-ui-with-mantine) _on the_ [_InstaNext_](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/series/insta-next) _series received a lot of views probably from Google search, so I am dedicating a full article on the topic._

I am a big fan of the **Mantine + Tailwind** combo and have convinced several people to adopt this combo. While both are quite popular on their own, I guess the combo is still relatively less popular, so I'd like to share a little on **how to use them well**, and **what is so good about this**.

PS: The [lead of Mantine](https://github.com/rtivital) **does not like** Tailwind, so you'll never see Tailwind on Mantine documentation, but they go very well together for me.

## Quick Intro

### Mantine

If you don't know about it yet, [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is a **React component library** that provides **over 100 components**, almost everything that you need in a project.

Beyond that, they also provide a lot of **utility hooks**, so you almost don't need to install additional utility libraries most of the time.

### Tailwind

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="rFkZ8K9"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of Tailwind website"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

Meanwhile, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a CSS class library. You write classes instead of CSS which is more uniform.

## Installation

Let's just say that this is very trivial for starters. You can simply follow the **installation guides** and install the libraries, and they should be available right away.

Check out the installation page for [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). _(I'd probably be copying the codes from there even if I include them here)_

Anyway, I'll include a short guide on installation with Mantine and Tailwind for Next.js _(I don't use anything else nowadays)_

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

While the other options depend on your preference, make sure you use **Tailwind CSS,** that'd skip some initial setup things.

  height={400}
/>

To set up Mantine, you'd want to first install the packages. These are the core packages, you can add on other [additional packages](https://mantine.dev/pages/getting-started/#get-started-without-framework) if you need them.

```bash
yarn add @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react
```

Finally, add the necessary theme provider in `_app.tsx`, the codes are taken from the [documentation](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/).

```tsx
// _app.tsx
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core'

export default function App(props: AppProps) {
  const { Component, pageProps } = props

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Page title</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width" />
      </Head>

      <MantineProvider
        withGlobalStyles
        withNormalizeCSS
        theme={{
          /** Put your mantine theme override here */
          colorScheme: 'light',
        }}
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MantineProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

## What's good?

I mean even the Mantine project lead dislikes Tailwind, so why am I promoting it?

That's because, for me, **Tailwind fills in the gap of Mantine**, and **Mantine is great**.

### What's great with Mantine

1. **Many Components**

   Mantine basically has **most of what you need**. With other libraries, you might still need to **install external libraries** for missing components and even need to **fix** the themes of the extra components.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="USonKxs"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of Mantine's Carousel component"
     width={500}
     height={400}
   />

   Usually, I look for a **Carousel** component, and so far Mantine appears to be one of the rare ones that have it out of the box. _(Not in the core, but available as one of the packages)_  
   Fun fact, Mantine even provides sample codes for [Drag' n' Drop](https://ui.mantine.dev/category/dnd).

2. **Customizability**

   Mantine gives you the power to use **CSS classes** or even **CSS-in-JS** to style any part of the component. For example, you can even use CSS selectors

   ```tsx
   <Button
     leftIcon={<IconBrandTwitter size={rem(18)} />}
     styles={(theme) => ({
       root: {
         backgroundColor: '#00acee',
         border: 0,
         height: rem(42),
         paddingLeft: rem(20),
         paddingRight: rem(20),
         '&:not([data-disabled])': theme.fn.hover({
           backgroundColor: theme.fn.darken('#00acee', 0.05),
         }),
       },
       leftIcon: {
         marginRight: theme.spacing.md,
      },
     })}
     Follow on Twitter
   </Button>
   ```

   _You can just target the_ `leftIcon`.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="lWXiod5"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of Mantine's button with updated leftIcon"
     width={300}
     height={200}
   />

   The best part is that Mantine does so **without having to burden us** users with nested components like Headless UI

   ```tsx
   // https://headlessui.com/react/listbox
   <Listbox value={selected} onChange={setSelected}>
     <div className="relative mt-1">
       <Listbox.Button className="relative w-full cursor-default rounded-lg bg-white py-2 pl-3 pr-10 text-left shadow-md focus:outline-none focus-visible:border-indigo-500 focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white focus-visible:ring-opacity-75 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-orange-300 sm:text-sm">
         <span className="block truncate">{selected.name}</span>
         <span className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center pr-2">
           <ChevronUpDownIcon
              className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-400"
              aria-hidden="true"
           />
         </span>
   </Listbox.Button>
   ```

   While many other libraries do provide this kind of functionality these days, some big popular frameworks still need you to add CSS rules to the components' classes to modify the style (like Ant Design).

   Nevertheless, I find this a **must-have** for myself as it's not uncommon to **customize nested parts** of a component to match your overall theme.

3. **Nicely Styled**

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="XDG9qWB"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of Mantine UI website"
     width={500}
     height={400}
     href="https://ui.mantine.dev/category/hero"
   />

   Typically, when people talk about Tailwind, **unstyled** [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) or the new [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) are often preferred over styled-components. However, I wouldn't want to create my buttons from scratch, to include styles for variants like outlined, solid, link, etc.

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="VP8xvWi"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of different variant of Mantine buttons"
     width={500}
     height={400}
     href="https://mantine.dev/core/button/#variants"
   />

   Yes, there are CSS libraries like [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) for that, but I prefer having my life easier at times like this. Most importantly, if the default styles for Mantine is great, why not right?

   Of course, for enterprise-level software, where a specific design system has been made, unstyled components might be a better option _(but Mantine does provide that too if you need it)_

4. **Form Integration**

   This is one of my favorites, unlike other component libraries that typically rely on [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) for form validation, Mantine provides its own [use-form hook](https://mantine.dev/form/use-form/) out of the box!

   ```tsx
   // example using Zod library
   import { z } from "zod";

   const authSchema = z.object({
     email: z.string().email("Invalid email").min(1, "Email is required"),
     password: z.string().min(1, "Password is required"),
   });

   const LoginForm = () => {
     const form = useForm<AuthType>({
       validate: zodResolver(authSchema),
       initialValues: {
         email: "hohshenyien@gmail.com",
         password: "asdf",
       },
     });

     return (
     <form className="space-y-2" onSubmit={form.onSubmit(submitForm)}>
       <TextInput
         label="Email"
         placeholder="example@mail.com"
         variant="filled"
         {...form.getInputProps("email")}
       />
       <PasswordInput
         label="Password"
         variant="filled"
         {...form.getInputProps("password")}
       />
   ...
   }
   ```

   _Not that I dislike react hook form, but sometimes it's a little annoying if the component library isn't directly compatible with it..._

### Limitation of Mantine

**Note**: _This is totally opinionated, others may find it otherwise._

1. **Insufficient Spacing**

   To demonstrate what I mean, look at this [Stack](https://mantine.dev/core/stack/) component

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="Fpubkon"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of Mantine UI website"
     width={500}
     height={400}
   />

   See those 5 values on the Spacing? Yes, Mantine only provides `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. Want more? You'd have to put values like `5px`. It's not just limited to this component, it's everywhere, from margin, and padding, to font sizes...

   Unfortunately, using custom values poses **more inconsistencies** to me, what if some developers use 5px, and others use 6px? Looks similar enough, but this kind of inconsistency is simply bad.

2. **CSS-in-JS**

   We all love CSS, yes. However, I don't really like CSS in JS, when Tailwind is present, like look at this

   ```tsx
   // https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/#unstyled-tabs
   function StyledTabs(props: TabsProps) {
     return (
       <Tabs
         unstyled
         styles={(theme) => ({
           tab: {
             ...theme.fn.focusStyles(),
             backgroundColor: theme.colorScheme === 'dark' ? theme.colors.dark[6] : theme.white,
             color: theme.colorScheme === 'dark' ? theme.colors.dark[0] : theme.colors.gray[9],
             border: `${rem(1)} solid ${theme.colorScheme === 'dark' ? theme.colors.dark[6] : theme.colors.gray[4]}`,
             padding: `${theme.spacing.xs} ${theme.spacing.md}`,
             cursor: 'pointer',
             fontSize: theme.fontSizes.sm,
             display: 'flex',
             alignItems: 'center',

             '&:disabled': {
               opacity: 0.5,
               cursor: 'not-allowed',
             },
   ```

   At least for me, I wouldn't want to **clutter** the TSX file with CSS, and it's not really that readable in my opinion.

   Of course, there are also many who love CSS-in-JS, so this is just my preference.

### Where Tailwind Fills the Gap

Corresponding to the two points above,

1. **More Variability**

   Want a bigger gap? Sure, there's a range from `gap-1` all the way to `gap-96`, and the same for anything from margin, and padding, to spacing. That's where **Mantine lacks** and for now, **Tailwind fills in perfectly**!

   <ImgurImage
     size="huge thumbnail"
     imgurId="WP07Jnd"
     format="png"
     alt="Screenshot of Tailwind spacing"
     width={500}
     height={400}
     href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin#add-margin-to-a-single-side"
   />

   _While I do prefer Mantine UI, I do wish for_ [_Chakra UI_](https://chakra-ui.com/)_'s_ [_Style Props_](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/style-props) _in Mantine sometimes._

2. **Readability**  
   Compared to CSS-in-JS, I prefer Tailwind classes, it's like reading variables, and more **comprehensible**.  
   Of course, **long Tailwind classes are bad**, so you still need to somewhat plan your classnames properly.

   ```tsx
   // typical buttons with very very long classnames
   // which is kinda ugly
   <button className="hover:bg-gray- inline-flex justify-center rounded-md bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900 shadow-sm ring-1 ring-inset ring-gray-300"></button>
   ```

## Tweaks

While you can certainly start using Tailwind + Mantine at this point, there are still some **minor issues**. Here are some tweaks that address those issues

### Disabling Tailwind Preflight

Tailwind's [Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) is a set of base styles to **_reset_** default styles from the browser. For example, **headings are unstyled**, so your `<h1>` will look the same as your `<p>`.

Our only concern will be buttons. Tailwind will **reset the background colors of buttons**. This means that your buttons will be **transparent** regardless of the colors you chose for Mantine buttons.
https://i.imgur.com/zSiIM4a.png

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="zSiIM4a"
  format="png"
  alt="Screenshot of Tailwind preflight overriding Mantine's styles"
  width={300}
  height={500}
  caption={
    <>
      Image taken from{' '}
      <a
        href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72083381/load-mantine-styles-after-tailwind-preflight"
        target="_blank"
      >
        Stackoverflow post
      </a>
    </>
  }
/>

You can see that the Mantine's background colors are **overridden** by Tailwind's Preflight (global.css), and you certainly don't want an empty button to style yourself right?

To fix that, you will first need to disable Tailwind's Preflight in `tailwind.config.js`

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false, // This line is important
  },
  ...
}
```

However, you might still want to include other rules, for example, I dislike seeing an underline on my link buttons.

You can always download a raw copy of the [preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@3.0.24/src/css/preflight.css) and remove the rules that you dislike. That's what I did in my [next-power-starter](https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter) package where I removed that rule that resets buttons' backgrounds, check out the [updated preflight](https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter/blob/main/src/styles/preflight.css).

Of course, don't forget to include the updated `preflight.css` in your `_app.tsx`

```tsx
// _app.tsx
import '@/styles/preflight.css'
```

_Before this, I added the styles manually to my buttons because of Tailwind_ 🥲

### Theming Mantine with Tailwind

Let's take a look with the **colors**, I'll just take blue for example

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="qzxKpXk"
  format="png"
  alt="Comparing Mantine and Tailwind Blue 400"
  width={400}
  height={300}
/>

They kinda look similar, but not exactly the same, and the last thing you want is to have different sets **of colors** everywhere. Some buttons have darker blue while others are lighter blue.

Does this limit us to using only one of the colors? **NO**

While it is somewhat tedious, the easiest way is to define **tailwind colors in Mantine** _(or Mantine's colors in Tailwind, if you prefer it that way)_

Typically, I'd create a Mantine theme file to define a customized theme and pass it to the `MantineProvider` like this

```typescript
// styles/MantineTheme.ts
const tailwindColors = {
  gray: [
    "#F9FAFB",
    "#F3F4F6",
    "#E5E7EB",
    "#D1D5DB",
    "#9CA3AF",
    "#6B7280",
    "#4B5563",
    "#374151",
    "#1F2937",
    "#111827",
  ],
   ...
}

const theme: MantineThemeOverride = {
  colors: tailwindColors,
  colorScheme: "light",
};

export default theme;
```

```tsx
// _app.tsx
import theme from "@/styles/MantineTheme";
...
<MantineProvider withGlobalStyles withNormalizeCSS theme={theme}>
...
```

Check out the complete Tailwind colors in Mantine [here](https://github.com/HohShenYien/next-power-starter/blob/main/src/styles/MantineTheme.ts). _(I think it still misses a few colors, I got it from ChatGPT)_

## Tips & Tricks

### Conditional Classes

When it comes to **conditional classes**, e.g., div needs to be red if `variable` is 1 or green otherwise? Typically, this is done using a **ternary operator** like this

```tsx
<div className={variable === 1 ? 'bg-red-400' : 'bg-green-400'}></div>
```

But what if the condition is complex? Say in addition to the condition above, you wanna make the div orange if it's 2

```tsx
<div
  className={variable === 1 ? 'bg-red-400' : variable === 2 ? 'bg-orange-400' : 'bg-green-400'}
></div>
```

Kinda messy right? Imagine having more conditions and classes, it's going to be insane!

But yeah, basically Tailwind, as it is, will be really **messy**, so what to do?

**The** [**clsx**](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) **API**

Not an additional package, you can import directly from Mantine/core

```tsx
import { clsx } from 'mantine/core'
```

Simply pass the classnames as keys, and the boolean variable as value, clsx will parse it into the right string

```tsx
<div
  className={clsx({
    'bg-red-400': variable === 1,
    'bg-orange-400': variable === 2,
    'bg-green-400': variable !== 1 && variable !== 2,
  })}
></div>
```

It is somewhat longer, but it's more readable.

`clsx` is always a handy function to use everywhere, it can also help **concatenate the classes** from arrays, string literals, variables, and objects:

```tsx
<div className={clsx('bg-red-400', someVar, { 'bg-red-400': variable === 1 })}></div>
```

### Targeting Subclasses

As mentioned earlier, everything in Mantine is stylable, so to apply Tailwind in Mantine, the best way is via `classNames` props. _(notice the extra "s")_

For example, looking at the tabs, you might want to only color the texts and not the icons, so open up your **inspector** (or check the [Styes API](https://mantine.dev/core/tabs/?t=styles-api))

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="U4FAgpv"
  format="png"
  alt="Inner class of Mantine components"
  width={400}
  height={300}
/>

Notice that there's a `tabLabel` in the class? `(the last string)` Yupp, that's the target class for classnames, so to set the colors for the texts

```tsx
// pass the tailwind classes as values to the target keys
<Tabs classNames={{tabLabel: "text-red-400"}}>
```

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="jxRzQKG"
  format="png"
  alt="Results of modifying inner class style"
  width={300}
  height={200}
/>

As simple as that!

## Conclusion

Using the tips and tweaks above, your experience with Mantine + Tailwind should be wonderful! There is **no limit** to this combo, and everything has been pleasant as of now.

Once again, this is from my personal experience of using them, which is around a year now, I hope this article can benefit you as much!
