Have you ever come across a fancy one-liner in Python that can do what supposedly 10-20 lines of code do?

Here's a simple example:

```python
## Printing triangle in one-liner
height = 10
[print("".join(x)) for x in [[" " if i < k else "#" for i in range(height)] for k in range(height)]]
```

and the result:

```plaintext
##########
 #########
  ########
   #######
    ######
     #####
      ####
       ###
        ##
         #
```

**Warning**: Please don't use this for any real projects, they're cool but bad for eyes

## Prerequisites

You don't expect to just learn it straight away....right?

### List Comprehension

[List Comprehension](https://peps.python.org/pep-0202/) is a <abbr>Syntactic sugar</abbr> that helps Pythonistas to **create a new list easily from existing values**.

Here's an example to show the difference to create a list of increasing integers:

```python
# Creating a list of [1,2,3,4,...n]
n = 10

## Using normal way
li = []
for i in range(n):
    li.append(i + 1)

## Using List Comprehension
li = [i + 1 for i in range(n)]
```

I hope you'd agree with me that the second approach is shorter üòå

Overall, list comprehension consists of three parts:

1. **Square Brackets -** List comprehension creates lists, so we wrap them in square brakcets to make it a list.
    
2. **The Value** \- This is the value you want to be in the list. You can **call functions**, or do **simple operations**, and the **returned value will be in the list**.
    
    ```python
    [x for x in range(3)] # [0, 1, 2]
    [i + 1 for i in range(3)] # [1, 2, 3]
    [j % 2 == 1 for j in range(3)] # [False, True, False]
    
    def randomFunction(value):
        return value + 10
    [randomFunction(haha) for haha in range(3)] # [10, 11, 12]
    ```
    
3. **The original list** \- This is the source list, where its elements will be fed to **the value**.
    
    You can imagine that in list comprehension, we are copying things from **original list** to **new list**. At the same time, we can apply some transformations if we wish to.
    
    Does it sound familiar? List comprehension is a lot like map!
    
    ```python
    ## x: x + 1 is a lambda function, which returns x + 1 from x
    map(x: x + 1, range(3)) # [1, 2, 3]
    ```
    

In our quest to writing one liners, list comprehension is like the MVP. It will help us **shorten our for-loops into single lines**.

### Ternary Operators

The [ternary operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_conditional_operator) is yet another syntactic sugar to write a **Yes/No condition**.

If you come from any other languages, this is your ternary operator:

```java
codition? "YES" : "NO"
```

But in Python, we have it this way

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="oNquKQv"
  format="png"
  alt="Ternary Operator in Python"
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

```python
"YES" if condition else "NO"
# is the same as
def yesNo(condition):
    if condition:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

So basically, ternary operators will help us to **simplify the logics into a single line**.

### Printing in List Comprehension

**Note:** While the above two are concepts, this is a [bad practice](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5753597/is-it-pythonic-to-use-list-comprehensions-for-just-side-effects) that you shouldn't use.

Now, very often we need to print something out to impress people with our one-liners right? Certainly, you don't want to print this:

```python
[['#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],
 [' ', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],
 [' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],
 [' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#', '#'], 
 [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '#']]
```

How then?

We will call print while using our list comprehension:

```python
[print(x) for x in range(3)] # [None, None, None] -> print returns None
# 0
# 1
# 2
```

Besides, sometimes we might need to use `string.join(list)` or other string / list manipulations to achieve our goals, but nonetheless, these are all the prerequisites.

## Coding Time!

After all the tedious prerequisites, now let's begin üíÉ

We will attempt to print a nicer triangle üîº instead of the half one earlier:

```plaintext
          #
         ###
        #####
       #######
      #########
     ###########
    #############
   ###############
  #################
 ###################
```

### Step 1: Writing the Normal Codes

Yes, the first step to one-liners is actually **writing codes the usual way,** we will **transform them into one-liner** later.

What a bummer üí©, I know, but you can **skip this step once you're more familiar**

#### The Math Way

Technically we can do some math to count the spaces and #'s:

```python
height = 10

for i in range(height):
    print(" " * (height - i), end="")
    ## Notice that going down each layer, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,...
    print("#" * (2 * i + 1))
```

While this is the usual approach we'll choose, but they're less impressive ü´£

#### The Verbose Way

Notice that I try to minimize the lines in a block, and prefer to use more for & ifs:

```python
height = 10

for i in range(height):
    ## This for loop prints this left half triangle /
    for j in range(height):
        ## Trying to keep only one if-else or for in each level
        if j < height - i:
            print(" ", end="")
        else:
            print("#", end="")
    ## This part prints the right half |\
    for j in range(i + 1):
        print("#", end="")
    print()
```

### Step 2: Transformation

Since we're using list comprehension, we should try to first get the output in a list like:

```python
["  #", " ###", "#####"]
## Or
[[" ", " ", "#",], [" ", "#", "#", "#"], ["#","#","#","#","#"]]
```

Then we can print them out one by one through printing list comprehension.

#### The Math Way

Let's transform the simpler math way first,

1. We can start by converting the outermost for loop into a list comprehension
    
    ```python
    [something for i in range(height)] 
    ```
    
2. Next, let's move the logic into our *something*
    
    ```python
    [" " * (height - i) + "#" * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(height)]
    ## ["  #", " ###", "#####"]
    ```
    
    Notice that I've removed the `print`, though I can keep it there, but let's put `print` last
    
3. Printing out, we can either print out right away since the result is already ready, or we can wrap another list comprehension
    
    ```python
    [print(" " * (height - i) + "#" * (2 * i + 1)) for i in range(height)]
    ## Or
    [print(x) for x in [" " * (height - i) + "#" * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(height)]]
    ```
    

That's it, pretty straight forward right? Let's move on to the more challenging part

#### The Verbose Way

1. Let's first move the outer for-loops
    
    ```python
    [something for i in range(height)]
    ```
    
2. Then the first inner loops, just substitute into *something*
    
    ```python
    [[first_loop for j in range(height)] for i in range(height)]
    ```
    
    Now, how do we move the second inner loop?
    
    *that's why it's preferred to have only one if-else and for*
    
3. We can simply **concatenate / add** the loops together:
    
    ```python
    # I try to clean it a bit
    [
            [first_loop for j in range(height)] +
            [second_loop for j in range(i + 1)]
        for i in range(height)
    ]
    ```
    
4. We now move the if-else into our **ternary operator**
    
    ```python
    [
            [" " if j < height - i else "#" for j in range(height)] +
            [second_loop for j in range(i + 1)]
        for i in range(height)
    ]
    ```
    
5. Next, the simpler `second_loop`
    
    ```python
    [
            [" " if j < height - i else "#" for j in range(height)] +
            ["#" for j in range(i + 1)]
        for i in range(height)
    ]
    ## [[" ", " ", "#",], [" ", "#", "#", "#"], ["#","#","#","#","#"]]
    ```
    
6. Finally, let's print them out, I will use `join` to flatten the inner lists:
    
    ```python
    [
        print("".join(x)) for x in
        [
                [" " if j < height - i else "#" for j in range(height)] +
                ["#" for j in range(i + 1)]
            for i in range(height)
        ]
    ]
    ```
    

Ta-da, now you have an impressive one-liner, after compressing the lines:

```python
[print("".join(x)) for x in [[" " if j < height - i else "#" for j in range(height)] + ["#" for j in range(i + 1)] for i in range(height)]]
```

## Summary

Of course, I've only shown a relatively simple shape here, Python's one-liner is quite strong in the sense that you can build a lot with it.

While it is pretty impressive, there's **no readability**.

Again, please **don't use** one-liners in your real projects, no one, including yourself, knows what did you write. Nevertheless, feel free to impress your friends & colleagues with this new skill üòè
