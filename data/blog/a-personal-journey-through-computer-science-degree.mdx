<TOCInline toc={props.toc} />

Having recently completed my degree in Computer Science, I thought it'd be a good time to share about the three-year journey.

A little background of myself, I'm a Malaysian software engineer who graduated from [Asia Pacific University](https://www.apu.edu.my/) (APU), a local Malaysian university. I took [Computer Science with a specialism in Data Analytics](https://www.apu.edu.my/our-courses/undergraduate-studies/school-computing-technology/bsc-hons-computer-science-specialism).

## Prelude: Making Tough Decisions

### Intrigued for Programming

<ImgurImage size="large thumbnail" imgurId="rfKqeNc" format="png" alt="I used to love science" width={400} height={300} caption="Science was my dream in the past"/>

I was a **pure science student**, aspiring to become a professor or engineer prior to my degree. I even had a naive ambition to get the Nobel Prize! So, how did I end up becoming a programmer?

It started with every guy's dream of **building his own game**, and I was no special. I wanted to create simple text web-based games like [this](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) after playing a few. I began fiddling with HTML and CSS.

However, I had a lot of hard times, which is common for someone new. Naturally, I gave up after a few courses on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

I also had quite some interest in **Mathematics** back in the days, and I stumbled across [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (*Something like Leetcode, but there are only Mathematics problems*). I had a lot of fun doing the first few problems by hand to realize that other problems actually require programming!

That's when I truly began my programming journey with Python, and I love it!

*At this point, I still haven't considered taking programming as a profession.*

### Joining Data Analysis

**2020** was an interesting year, not just Covid-19, but also the blooming year of **Data Science** in my country. Everywhere is talking about Data Science, the greatness of data, and everything imaginable.

At the same time, I also learned that Engineering jobs in Malaysia pay rather badly, and also other Science careers in general (Might be just the news that I was exposed to).

I thought that since I kinda like Maths, and programming is quite fun, why not Data Analysis? I also somewhat believe that the **degree doesn't determine the career** that I'll be taking, so might as well give it a try.

And that, was how I started my programming journey.

### Entering APU

<ImgurImage size="large thumbnail" imgurId="ur5D3hT" format="jpeg" alt="An image of Asia Pacific University" width={400} height={300}/>

Well, let's start with the university. **Asia Pacific University** has some fame in Computer Science locally, and my friend said it was good. Most importantly, APU was quite near to my house, just about 10-15 minutes away, up to 30 minutes max during peak hours. After some consideration, I just registered for it.

*Simple as that, didn't consider much about its ranking or anything else, as I trust it's just a process.*

Fortunately, I did manage to secure a 50% waiver from my A-Levels results, which helped a lot financially.

## Navigating the Unknown

Life at university was very **different** from my college where I took A-levels.

<ImgurImage size="medium thumbnail" imgurId="hFuoRtx" format="png" alt="How much words I wrote" width={200} height={100} caption="Most assignments easily require over 5000 words"/>

It was still examination-based back then, but when the degree began, it became **assignments** everywhere. Even worse, others (teammates) will have a significant impact on my results! University was a strange world to me.

Besides, the modules and courses were also much **less structured**. While there were recommended readings, only specific parts would be baked into the overall curriculum. I was somewhat **lost** with this **new way of learning** in the beginning.

*Fortunately, along with me was another high school friend making this journey not alone.*

### The New World

As an ex-pure science student, the computing world does seem somewhat **alien** to me, in addition to the **business subjects** added by the university.

<ImgurImage size="large thumbnail" imgurId="JtC5zPt" format="png" alt="4 Pillars of OOP" width={400} height={300} caption="OOP was one of the most confusing subjects in the past, but I still liked it"/>

While there were **some resemblances to Physics and Mathematics**, the more theoretical sides such as Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, and Networking were more abstract. I for one, indeed **struggled a little** during the early phases of my degree.

Not to mention, the **business** and **project management subjects** which focused more on essay writing, posed quite some **challenges** to me too as I'm never really a writing person.

*Though till now I still am not sure why did I have to learn subjects like Management, Creativity and Innovation, and Digital Thinking which don't add much value.*

### Adapting to the Novelty

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="AtOZsKE" format="png" alt="Life cycle of a programming student" width={400} height={400} />

As time passed, everything began to feel normal again. After all, it was just cycles of **relaxation** (beginning), **panicking** (the number of assignments due), **rushing** (towards the submission), **cramming** (for finals), and **anxiety** (awaiting results).

Slowly, I discovered my **best approaches** to studying and completing assignments.

There was **rarely a need to continuously study** the materials over time as the exams were mostly **online-based**. More often than not, I just had to go through the slides a few days before the exam, and just search for the points online or from the slides during the exam.

On the other hand, **assignments require much more effort**. Most commonly, it would be a **several thousand words essay**, or in the format of a journal, on a certain topic. For instance, our computer architecture subject required us to conduct research on a computer model as a group.

<ImgurImage size="large thumbnail" imgurId="d2kniJ8" format="png" alt="My Real Time System Module assignment" width={600} height={600} caption="Benchmarking different methods during my Real Time System module" />

While I didn't like the majority of the modules (*due to various reasons*), I did have fun with several and even liked the assignment. This included **Concurrent Programming** where we did a multithreaded airplane simulation, and **Real-Time System** where we did research and benchmarking for Messaging platforms (RabbitMQ).

### Academic Triumps

<ImgurImage size="huge thumbnail" imgurId="mLwfXJb" format="png" alt="My CGPA in the 3 years" width={500} height={400} caption="My results have been relatively consistent across the three years" />

Despite the new formats in the university, I did manage to secure decent grades throughout, and obtain **first-class cgpa** in the end.

I guess it can also be partly attributed to the fact that most of my degree's subjects are relatively **easier**. There's no advanced Mathematics (not even Linear Algebra), our **programming assignments were mostly easy** (doing basic systems in CLI of course), and many **business subjects** (that you can score as long as you write).

I don't even know if it's something to be proud of for getting such results, but I guess it's somewhat satisfactory.

Most importantly, I might be able to apply for my **study loan exemption** with my results!

*I applied for about 40% of a study loan, with a 50% fee waiver, which almost equates to a full scholarship!*

## From a Mistake to President

I always believe that a **university life without clubs and societies is incomplete**.

In the degree, I ended up with the [Asia Pacific Analytics Club](https://www.instagram.com/apu.apac/). I wanted to join the Developers Club initially, but fate brought me there.

### How did I Join the Club?

It was a funny mistake,

<ImgurImage size="large thumbnail" imgurId="qjYfrWq" format="png" alt="A committee recruitment poster of my club" width={400} height={400} />

I came across this poster, and I thought it was for **member recruitment**. I filled in the registration form, then I was emailed for an interview. At that moment, I was like

**WOW, this must be an elite club, even the members need to be interviewed!**

Somehow I got through, and it was then I learned that this was a **committee recruitment session**.

### Life as Public Relations

Thanks to my previous [blogging](https://hohshenyien.github.io/), I was placed in the **PR department**. I was never a Social Media person, and of course, I rarely post. Writing social media posts was novel to me.

Nevertheless, it turned out to be quite nice! I always enjoyed sharing knowledge with others, and most of the time, my job in PR was to prepare this kind of stuff! [This](https://www.instagram.com/p/CSgIOoFJjAp) was my first content about Random Forest, good ol' time.

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="A7cgWui" format="png" alt="One of my PR posters for chatbot" width={700} height={700} caption="This was one of my best PR posts back then" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVUX_QVPNcy/?img_index=1"/>

I then continued to prepare content for like almost **half a year**. I guess this period was one of the **best moments** when I got to mix around with others, and sometimes talk and gossip for hours late at night.

Oh, and I actually built an [automatic mailer and certificate generator](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=apac-mailer) as well as a [website](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=apac-website) for the club. It was great to see how my work was put into practical use back then.

### Leading a Talk

<ImgurImage size="huge thumbnail" imgurId="GfF0Ltp" format="png" alt="An event poster for Breaking into the Data Industry" width={400} height={400} caption="This was the best event I hosted" />

At the same time, I was suddenly appointed as **event lead** for [an online talk](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWhn2EDvjyl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). As we managed to invite some big people in the field, this event got quite some participation. It somehow attracted **over 300 registrations**!

It was a busy period I remember, planning out timelines, sending emails, assigning tasks, and checking out others' progress. All of these are on top of my studies and assignments plus my part-time tuition teaching. Nevertheless, I made it through, and it was a **huge success** for me.

### Climbing up the Hierarchy

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="HuzEk2X" format="png" alt="A group picture with my club" width={800} height={400} />

As one semester ended, the committee reshuffled, and I got promoted to **vice president**. Everything seemed so great.

Things began to go **downhill**. 2 events planned for several months went nowhere, old committees began to quit, and some underperformed. The whole club seemed to be falling apart.

I wanted to give up multiple times, and finally, the next recruitment arrived, old committees left, but were replaced by more enthusiastic new committees. I became the **president** as the other vice did not wish to be one. Things went back **on track**, and the club was functional and lively again!

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="1gZfpii" format="png" alt="Another group picture with my club" width={800} height={400} />

Nevertheless, I did not stay for long, as I got **tied up** with my Final Year Project, and I was taking up part-times. I left after being the president for **merely 4 months**, but at least I left it in a good state, which I was proud of holding it together.

## Hackathons: Striking from Last

> — Me, 2021

Looking back, I can't help but to agree more with it. It **defined my success** in my degree life! *(I don't see my results being too successful, just somewhat above average)*

### Starting from the Bottom

I was practically a **newbie developer** when I started joining hackathons. I only had 1 year of experience max in writing basic text programs, using Python mostly, and I couldn't even write functional websites.

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="D9rOMRp" format="png" alt="My first Gifma design for a hackathon" width={700} height={500} caption="Probably my first Figma design, looks very ugly"/>

My very first hackathon was a **mobile application**, built using Java. Long story short, the **team dynamic wasn't there**, we **lacked the necessary skills**, and we **did not deliver** it well, but somehow we still ended up as 7th, probably because the idea was somewhat decent.

My second hackathon was somewhat better, winning **third place**, but there were only 5 teams. However, this was the moment I learned that technical skill is just one of the requirements, most importantly, there needs to be a **good business proposal**!

I still didn't manage to find a business person by the third hackathon, which was my **worst hackathon**. We basically built a plain website that has a Plotly chart on it plus a few funny recommendations. Very well expected, we kinda got roasted by one of the mentors, and I even had trauma for mentors and hackathons for a while...

Results-wise, these hackathons were bad. However, knowledge-wise, these first few hackathons **shaped my future successes**, learning the essential skills and began to understand what to expect from hackathons.

### Paving to Podium

As time passed, I got **better with coding**, **expanded my knowledge**, and most importantly, found the **key business person**, Nicole.

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="jxxysqw" format="png" alt="The design of my first hackathon champion solution" width={700} height={500} caption="The design of my first hackathon champion solution"/>

After pausing for about 6-7 months, we joined another hackathon, and to my surprise, we won the **champion**! It was a mobile application for [community security](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=kommunity). I thought it might still be a sheer fluke, which wasn't at all!

Fast forward to May of this year, we formed a new team, officially calling ourselves **DoBetter**. It was our first **3-day-2-night physical hackathon**, and we won! This was a key moment that maxed out my faith in the team. I started to see how great the team dynamic was, there was **creativity**, **strong presentation and business knowledge**, and of course, we had **strong technical backgrounds**.

<ImgurImage size="huge thumbnail" imgurId="6fb0fVr" format="png" alt="Group photo of my best hackathon" width={500} height={500} caption="This was my team DoBetter"/>

We then managed to trump one **final hackathon** before graduating. It was a huge hackathon, and even featured on [Digital News Asia](https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/team-dobetter-wins-first-impacthack-2023-hackathon-standard-chartered)!

### Reflecting the Journey

The entire process of a hackathon is definitely a **grind**, and I do feel like quitting at times. Even after winning some hackathons, we still get flamed by mentors for unfeasible ideas, bad executions, or lack of depth.

However, the **real thrill** sets in when you see your prototype is working, when the **mentors like the ideas**, and most significantly, when the **solution is presented**. Of course, there's the **prize** part, but yeah.

I can't help but find myself lucky to meet a great team despite being in the last year of my degree.

Regardless, these hackathons certainly helped to **build my technical skills** early on in my CS journey, brought invaluable exposure to different industries, and ultimately led to my current job.

I never regret joining hackathons, and thus I believe I leave no regrets for my degrees.

## Journey to Software Engineer

I took up a Data Analysis course, but how did I end up being a SE now?

### First Taste of Web Development

While I had some experience in writing basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, but I knew **nothing about Web Development**.

However, during one fateful day, I was presenting my assignment in the class, which I built using HTML *(while most others made using Figma, but I didn't know how to use it)*, and I was invited to join a [startup project](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=website-editor).

<ImgurImage size="huge thumbnail" imgurId="NBYYp7q" format="png" alt="The looks of my first Laravel project" width={600} height={400} caption="My first Laravel project"/>

Long story short, it didn't work, but I had my very first exposure to **Laravel** and **Vue**, and it got me a developer part-time! While there was also a [project](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=starbucks-coffee-at-home) using Laravel & Vue, the remaining were WordPress projects.

**Wouldn't say WordPress development is fun**, but I did somewhat get better with Javascript and UI Design. I also agree to a level that different tools are suitable for different tasks, and in this case, WordPress is certainly more suitable for fast and simple static E-Commerce websites.

### Transitioning to Software Engineering

Halfway through my degree, I realized that I **didn't like Data Analysis**, I never really liked building dashboards like Power BI, I didn't like to wait while training models, and I'm not that into handling that much data. Rather, I **like to build apps and systems**, like something with a UI that I can see and use, and not just plain data.

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="IVU10qn" format="png" alt="Screenshots of a food delivery platform" width={700} height={700} caption="Loopfood, the project I did during my part-time" href="https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=loopfoods"/>

Knowing my preference, I took up a **developer internship**, at a startup. It was followed by another web development part-time at an agency, which was in turn working on a [startup project](https://shenyien.cyou/projects?project=loopfoods). I really **enjoyed and loved the work**, and so I successfully transitioned into a Software Engineer.

It was actually a **continuous learning process**, as I started out with basic HTML, to simple web apps, a big SaaS system, and eventually to building huge apps from scratch. My preferences and skills also come and go, from Bootstrap to Laravel + Vue, Next.js, and more.

Of course, my degree was still a **great exposure to the world of AI and ML**, which is arguably useful in this era of AI.

## What's Next?

While I do have big dreams and ambitions, I believe that it's important to **start from scratch**. I am now building my technical skills and expertise, and most importantly, **things beyond tech side**. Therefore, I am currently working as an engineer but have also been given the opportunity to try out a few non-tech things.

I will still be **joining hackathons actively**, but I gotta admit that the energy and enthusiasm have somewhat faded.

But well, this is going to be a new chapter of life, only time will tell where will I head in the future!
