Leetcode problem: [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Example 1

```plaintext
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2

```plaintext
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3

```plaintext
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Constraints

* `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
    
* `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
    

## Discussion

### Concepts

The concepts in this question can be found through keywords:

1. **Hash Table** - Notice that the question mentioned “**without repeating**”, and the hash table is usually the best O(1) technique to **detect repetition**
    
2. **Sliding window** - The keyword here is “**longest substring**”, substring means that all the characters are contiguous, i.e., next to each other, and sliding window is one of the approaches in dealing with a **contiguous subset of a set / array**.
    

### Brute Force Attempt

The brute force attempt will involve **examining all substrings** of the `s` and **find the longest unrepeated substring** from there.

1. Iterating all substrings will require $O(n^2)$ time complexity:
    
    ```python
    longest = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
    	    substring = s[i:j]
        if (not hasRepetition(substring)):
            longest = max(longest, substring)
    ```
    
2. Meanwhile, checking for repetition of a substring of length m will require $O(m)$
    
    ```python
    def hasRepetition(substring):
        hashmap = {}
        for char in substring:
            if char in hashmap:
                return True
            hashmap[char] = True
        return False
    ```
    

Overall, the time complexity of the brute force attempt is

$$1+(1+2)+(1+2+3)+...+(1+2+...+n)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\sum_{j=1}^{i} j)$$

We know that the **summation series** is $O(n^2)$, so we can simplify it to

$$1^2 + (2^2) + (3^2) + (4^2) + \dots = \sum_{x=1}^{n}x^2$$

Which then simplifies the time complexity

$O(n^3)$

Which is kinda **slow**

## Optimal Approach

### Idea

We will have a ***window***, where the window only includes non-repeating substring.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="JR37L6X"
  format="png"
  alt="Graphic showing the window size"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

The window will expand (the ***right pointer*** moving to the right) in every iteration.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="IX98LSz"
  format="png"
  alt="Graphic showing the movement of window"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Before moving, we will examine if the ***new right*** (”e”) is **repeated** in the window or not, now, there will be two scenarios:

1. **No**, the character is not in the window.
    
2. **Yes**, the character is in the window
    

And in this case, we can see that the current window “abc” does not include “e”, therefore **we can continue expanding**.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="5emoqt8"
  format="png"
  alt="New window"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Again, we examine the ***new right*** “a”.

This time, we can see that “a” is in the window, “abce”, so what now? We shift our ***left*** until the previous “a” is removed from the window.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="CoW6FvH"
  format="png"
  alt="More movement of window"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

That’s it! Now our window will be all unique again if we include the new “a”, so we now expand the ***new right***, and continue the process.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="kNtUMFO"
  format="png"
  alt="Last iteration"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Now, the ***new right***, “a”, can be found in the window again, so likewise, we move left till the previous “a” is removed, and include the ***new right***.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="4LPxiZB"
  format="png"
  alt="Final window"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Finally, since the ***right pointer*** has reached the end, we are done!

So what’s the longest substring we have here? “abce” and “bcea”, both of which have length 4, and that’s the answer.

### Codes

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        left, longest = 0, 0
        seen = {}
        for right, char in enumerate(s):
            ## Checking if the character is in the window
            if char in seen and seen[char] >= left:
                ## Moving the left pointer
                left = seen[char] + 1
            else:
                longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)
            seen[char] = right
        return longest
```

Note that there has been an **improvement** in this implementation.

Rather than moving the ***left*** pointer step by step till we reach the previous character, I store the position of the chars in the dictionary.

For example:

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="lS1KTqN"
  format="png"
  alt="Describing the dictionary"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

```python
seen = {"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2, "e": 3}
```

Hence, when I encountered “a” again, I can shift my **left pointer** to `seen[”a”] + 1`, rather than moving step by step.

Besides, to check if the character is in the window through this method, we first determine if the character is in `seen` , then we check its position if it is within the window. To be in the window, Index<sub>character</sub> ***left pointer***.

## Analysis

### Time Complexity

As we can see from the idea that we will be iterating the string only once, hence, the time complexity will be $O(n)$

### Space Complexity

The space occupied by the dictionary `seen` will be $O(m)$, where m is the number of unique characters in the string, in the worst case, it will be $O(n)$.

## Last Words

This was one of the earliest problems I did back in 2019, while I made it seem to be on the easier side, it's not.

On its own, this question will require a person to know about **sliding window**, which is only a concept to be learned through solving Leetcode, and it's pretty uncommon outside of Leetcode.
