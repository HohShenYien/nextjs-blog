In this introspective blog post, I will reflect upon my developer journey this year and what‚Äôs next.

## From Data to Web

### Specializing into Data

/>

Years ago, when I was still a newbie programmer, everyone was and is still discussing data: **Data Boom, Data is the New Gold, Data Revolution, etc.**

Naturally, my mind told me this, ‚ÄúHey Shen Yien, you like programming and Math, and Data Science was about programming and Math (Stats), so you must love Data Science‚Äù, and looking at the trend, I was convinced, not to mention the prospect of the jobs ü§ë

That was the story of how I registered for Asia Pacific University‚Äôs Data Analytics course.

### Reality vs Expectation

Before registering myself, I took [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org)‚Äôs **Introduction to Machine Learning** (*I couldn't find the link again*) and [CS50ai](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), and they gave me high expectations about the course.

However, after two years of learning in the field, I realized that it might be far from expectations. Yes, there are a lot of numbers in it, but there were many aspects that I dislike too:

1. **Data Visualization with Tableau and PowerBI**, those are definitely great tools, but I personally prefer visualizing with R or Python, which as far as I know, weren‚Äôt the standard in the field
    
2. **Presentation and Reporting**, well, I guess it‚Äôs just not a thing everyone likes to do, I personally especially dislike doing PPT slides
    
3. **Black box,** imagine spending hours tuning a parameter to improve the model's accuracy, but you simply can‚Äôt explain why is it better
    

so yeah, I ended up not liking it.

### Crack of Dawn

Being in dilemma, I still applied for roles as **Data Analyst** for my internship. At the same time, I didn‚Äôt know what strike me, but I felt like trying to apply for Software Engineering roles.

And‚Ä¶ my opportunity came! I received my first reply from **SupplyCart**, a Malaysia-based procurement software start-up. There was a simple [take-home assessment](https://github.com/HohShenYien/interview-case-study), I did it, and reached the interview phase.

It was during the interview that I realized this is the environment and they are the kind of people **I want to work with**. Enthusiastic in tech, friendly and down to earth in person ü•∞

Not long later, I accepted their internship offer and began my journey in web development.

## First Taste of Web Developer

/>

Throughout the year 2022, I have done 2 web developer roles. Both are in different fields using different stacks.

Programming for personal projects and established projects are **different**.

This was the time when I first learned about **Linting**, **CI/CD**, **Pull Requests and Test Driven Development**.

### Clearing the Doubt

As I program every day, I eventually cleared my doubt about my career path. I was certain that **fullstack developer** is what I'm looking for. I enjoyed the process of fixing bugs, building features from requirements, and solving real-world issues.

Over time, I began to **take ownership** of the project and **grew proud** of what I built. I have never had the same feeling from doing dashboards, analysis and training models. Plus, it turns out that I was pretty good at what I‚Äôm doing ü§©

Within a short time, I was offered a **permanent role** from my first internship. What more can I look for right? Doing something I‚Äôm good at and I‚Äôm interested in.

### Growth in Mind

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="89HnuC3"
  format="jpeg"
  alt="Levelling up"
  width={300}
  height={300}
/>

In the beginning, I felt unconfident of the implementation (*impostor syndrome?*), and doubtful towards my codes. I kept on thinking **there‚Äôll be better ways** of doing it, hence asking more.

However, over time, I became **confident** that I was implementing the requirements correctly in the right way and shifting the focus gradually from **codes to requirements**.

I believe that there can be **many correct ways** to implement the feature correctly, but there‚Äôs only **one set of requirements** that I need to follow. Of course, I guess becoming more familiar with the codebase was another contributing factor.

### Shift in Perspective

<ImgurImage

  alt="Viewing things in different pespective"
  width={300}
  height={250}

Before my first job, I thought language / framework is everything. I know x languages and y frameworks, which makes me a good programmer.

I was absolutely wrong.

Eventually, I realized that fundamental principles and concepts matter more. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the backend framework is, there‚Äôs always a controller, and route, OAuth2 works the same everywhere. Likewise, regardless of the frontend framework, there‚Äôs always the same component with props, onMounted method, reactive data, etc.

Yes, it‚Äôll still take time to migrate or learn a new framework / language, but give anyone a week or two working on the project, he‚Äôll grasp the syntax quickly.

Especially nowadays with ChatGPT ü§ñ, it‚Äôs pretty easy to implement anything basic like this, what distinguishes us from ChatGPT is the knowledge that we understand, which will not change from language to framework.

### Who is Senior

Yet another important experience is learning the difference between a senior and a junior developer. Long story short, you‚Äôll know it when you meet one.

Now the long story, from my perspective, I see a senior developer as someone who

1. **knows the entire project well**, they might not be familiar with the details of each module, but they are familiar with the large picture
    
2. can provide **helpful guidance** to others
    
3. is able to **identify risks and issues** early before or from code reviews
    
4. is **reliable**
    
5. has **experience** in the whole project lifecycle, from planning to execution
    
6. has **great domain knowledge**
    

After knowing what a great senior developer looks like, I now aspire to become one!

## Continuous Learning

I did not stop learning this year. Throughout the year, I have been picking up new skills mostly related to web development.

### Reading

<ImgurImage

  imgurId="HlhQhWM"
  format="jpeg"
  alt="Books and Reading"
  width={300}
  height={180}

Early this year, I set a goal to read a book a month, and guess what? I did it!

I‚Äôve in fact read a total of [16 books](https://shenyien.cyou/readings) this year, and I think that this would have easily been one of my best decisions this year.

Initially, I wanted to put my focus on programming / UX related books, nonetheless, it quickly expanded into other categories, including those that I won‚Äôt read in the past. I think it‚Äôs a good thing too, as reading the same genre for too long might get fatiguing, and a mix worked well for me.

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="YbQw6WB"

  height={200}

/>

I‚Äôd usually be reading e-books on my phone, using this great app called [Lithium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faultexception.reader&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1). Of course, the experience wasn‚Äôt as good as a physical book, but I can read it anywhere and anytime I wish, which is very convenient.

That was also how I tried to maximize my reading time by utilizing these time segments while I am free (*though half of the time I spent on social media / other stuff still*).

But yes, reading has really been a big help to my learning this year! I came across a lot of new ideas and knowledge that wouldn‚Äôt come to me otherwise.

### Programming

This year has really been a bloom in my web development knowledge this year!

As I am progressing in my internships, I‚Äôve learned quite a number of frameworks:

1. Django
    
2. Angular (*I know many said it‚Äôs dead, but it‚Äôs still popular though*)
    
    <ImgurImage
        size="huge thumbnail"
        imgurId="dsGlX9q"
        format="png"
        alt="Rankings of frontend framework over time"

        height={400}
        href="https://2021.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/"
        />
    
    *Angular still remains the second most popular among frontend frameworks*
    
3. Nest.js
    
4. tRPC
    
5. React Native
    

Oh, and earlier this year, when I was reading [The Pragmatic Programmer,](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) I was inspired to pick up a new programming language, and I ended up picking two of them:

1. Rust
    
2. Golang
    

Though after a few months, I have lost quite some memory of using them, those were some modern C-style languages and it was fun learning them ü§ì

## Life Beyond Codes

My life isn‚Äôt bound exactly to coding alone, there had been quite a lot of things this year too! (*skip ahead if you‚Äôre not into this*)

### University Life

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="jD1WAcw"
  format="jpeg"
  alt="Asia Pacific University"
  width={450}
  height={300}
/>

The first half of this year was mostly **spent online on my university**. Honestly, my second year went on pretty well, and I guess my CGPA of 3.91 was quite decent for the year.

While it was still online, I did meet quite a few cool people from my university too.

The only complaint? Well, the courses at my university were never relevant, but yeah, it‚Äôs not a top university, and I guess it‚Äôs pretty normal.

### Asia Pacific Analytics Club

This was the club I joined at end of year 1. By chance, I became the **president**. While it was a relatively minor and small club, I did get to host a few events this year.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="C1EkVlx"
  format="png"
  alt="This is my club profile"
  width={500}
  height={400}
  href="https://apu-apac.netlify.app/about"
/>

This club was the place where I met most of my friends from university, and quite some effort has been put into it. Nevertheless, as I‚Äôm going into my senior year, I will retire from the club in March of next year.

### First time Champion

*(not exactly beyond codes, but yeah)*

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="oxQvpzp"
  format="jpeg"
  alt="My first hackathon champion"
  width={440}
  height={440}
  href="https://www.apu.edu.my/media/news/2734"
/>

Honestly, I am not a very hackathon-ish person, but I do feel like joining some when it comes.

So there came a hackathon some time ago, and somehow, **my team won**! It was quite a standard **mobile solution hackathon**, with some prototypes, business proposals, pitching and development.

But yeah, it was quite a cruel period because I was having both a part-time and a full-time internship while doing the hackathon. However, the result was **super satisfying** and it was certainly a fond memory üòé

I‚Äôm still very grateful for teaming up with my awesome teammates, **@Rui Jun** and **@Nicole**. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it without them.

### Miscellaneous

Here are some other interesting things that happened this year:

1. I was offered a **full scholarship** for the remaining degree, but I rejected it. (*probably a story for some other days*)
    
2. I got into dating, but it didn‚Äôt go well and ended within 6 months.
    
3. I seem to be getting balder üë©‚Äçü¶≤
    
4. I started blogging more this year ([old blogs](https://v2.shenyien.cyou/csdiary))
    

## 2023 and Beyond

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="fNTQCWW"
  format="png"
  alt="To infinity and beyond!"
  width={300}
  height={300}

So what‚Äôs ahead of me? Honestly, **I don‚Äôt know**. However, the main direction will be toward **completing (and acing, hopefully) my degree**, **broadening my knowledge and skill**, as well as **seeking an optimal job**.

While being confident in my skills, I still feel uncertain about the exact direction. On one end, I love using **new technologies** like tRPC & Next.js combo, while on the other end, I felt like doing the more **traditional** Spring / Dotnet development. I really am uncertain.

Nonetheless, my upcoming focus would be learning one or two more frameworks (probably Dotnet and Ruby on Rails) to enrich my backend knowledge. For Frontend, I think I‚Äôm doing quite well, especially in React now.

However, as I shifted my focus to development, I think my **Leetcoding skill** became worse, not exactly sure if it‚Äôs gonna be useful in the future, but since it built my foundation, I should probably pick it up a bit too.

Aside from that, I would also like to improve my **domain knowledge**, primarily in **business** / **finance** area, so I‚Äôd probably pick up a few books on it.

I guess that‚Äôs a wrap! Look forward to my next year, and I hope it‚Äôll be better than this year üòÜ
