Annotations make up a huge part of Spring Boot. In fact, that's how Spring Boot came up — providing **annotations as configurations**, instead of manually defining the configurations in an XML file.

However, when starting in Spring Boot, these are the concepts that always baffle us, and often, we just use whatever *"seems right"* or copied from another class without understanding.

This article should shed some light on how these annotations come together in Spring Boot.

## Bean — The Foundation

The **core annotations** in Spring Boot, like `@Service`, `@Component`, `@Configuration`, `@Repository`, and of course, `@Bean`. While each has a different meaning, their main purpose is to define a **bean**.

**So what is a bean?**

### Beans as Singleton

Each bean will exist as a **singleton** in your application. In a formal definition,

> Singleton ... ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
> 
> Source: [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)

That is, in an application, there will only be a **single instance** of the class. For example, using the `@Component` annotation to define a bean

```java
@Component
public class CustomerFactory {
  ...
}
```

As a result, in your Spring application, there will be only **one, global** `CustomerFactory` instance.

To access these beans, we will leverage a second characteristic of Spring Boot applications — **Dependency Injections**.

### Dependency Injection — Bringing Beans Together

What if one bean needs to access another bean's functionality? For instance, my `CustomerService` class would need to access the database via `CustomerRepository`*(I'll explain these later, I promise)*, and this is where Spring Boot uses **Dependency Injection**

Since Spring Boot **instantiates all the beans when starting up**, Spring Boot will also **pass the beans to where needed**. Typically, it can be done by **declaring them in the constructor** or **using the annotation**`@Autowired`.

Personally, I prefer using Lombok's [`@RequiredArgConstructor`](https://www.baeldung.com/java-lombok-constructor-annotation), which will automatically create a constructor with all of the class's final fields.

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public CustomerService {
  private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

  // The constructor created by @RequiredArgsConstructor,
  // doesn't need to be created manually anymore.
  /* 
  * public CustomerService(CustomerRepository customerRepository) {
  *   this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
  * }
  */
}
```

When instantiating this `CustomerService`, Spring Boot will look at the constructor, and pass the `CustomerRepository` required.

*(It's kinda like building a dependency graph, so if CustomerService needs CustomerRepository, it will then look into CustomerRepository, see what it needs and builds it up)*

**Note**: A circular dependency can happen if say Service A requires Service B, and Service B needs Service A. Try to avoid it if possible, otherwise you'll need to [work around](https://www.baeldung.com/circular-dependencies-in-spring) it.

## Learning Annotations

Now that you understand what exactly a bean is in Spring Boot, let's see what each type of bean does.

**Note**: All of the following annotations will make the class a **bean**, however, some of them do come with additional functionalities.

### `@Component`

`@Component` is the most fundamental bean annotation in Spring Boot, the class will be turned into a bean with this annotation.

```java
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor // this is to automatically creates constructor
public class CustomerFactory {
  // Spring Boot will inject any bean required
  private final CustomerService customerService;
}

@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class CustomerGroupFactory {
  // and the component bean can also be freely injected in other beans
  private final CustomerFactory customerFactory;
}
```

### `@Service`

Actually, it's just the same as `@Component`. It just makes the class a bean.

`@Service` is more of a semantic feature, which marks that the class is one in the **Service Layer**. That is, the service is where the **business logic** is, here is where you process the data from users, save them in the database using the `repository`, and return the data back to the user via the `controller`.

Here's a very simple demonstration of the use of Service. While simplified, most [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) related operations, in their essence, are just like this.

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor // creates a constructor to inject CustomerRepository
public class CustomerService {
  private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;

  public CustomerDetails saveCustomer(SaveCustomerRequest request) {
    // First, we process the data from client, turn it into a backend object
    Customer customer = new Customer(request.name, request.email,...);

    // Then we save it into database via repository
    Customer savedCustomer = customerRepository.save(customer);

    // Lastly, we transform the data and pass it back to user
    return new CustomerDetails(savedCustomer.id, ...);
  }
}
```

## `@Configuration`

Again, like `@Component`, it **marks a class to be a bean**.

So it is more of a semantic feature again. It means that the class is **a configuration class that contains configuration beans**.

This typically occurs when we want to override the **default behavior** of Spring Boot, that is, override the default implementation of Spring Boot. A common example would be to [configure the security](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-custom-filter).

Of course, this configuration class can also consist of **custom configuration** specific to your application, for example, you might be defining a [RedisTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/reference/redis/template.html) to create a Redis client connected to your Redis cluster.

As `@Configuration` is usually used with `@Bean`, the example will go below.

## `@Bean`

It's finally something different. `@Bean` will mark the object returned from a method a bean.

Yupp, not the class, but the return type of the method.A

Beside the examples above, you might also want to create a [RestTemplate](https://www.baeldung.com/rest-template), to **send REST API calls to 3rd party applications** that only provide REST endpoints for integrations. Let's say this `RestTemplate` bean is specifically for this integration, so you'd want to set the base URL for it.

```java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig {
  // Retrieve the URL from configuration properties file
  @Value("${some-application.url}")
  private String someApplicationBaseUrl;

  @Bean("some-application")
  public RestTemplate getRestTemplate() {
    RestTemplate template = new RestTemplate();
    template.setUriTemplateHandler(
        new DefaultUriBuilderFactory("https://some-application.com")
    );
    return template;
  }
}
```

So now, we have a `RestTemplate` bean in our application! And as you might have **multiple**`RestTemplate` beans around since you might want to integrate with multiple 3rd parties, that's why we have annotated the bean with the name `"some-application"`.

If we wish to inject this particular `RestTemplate` bean with name `"some-application"`, we have to specify it via the `@Qualifier` annotation.

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class CustomerService {
  private final CustomerRepository customerRepository;
  private final RestTemplate someApplicationRestTemplate;

  public CustomerService(CustomerRepository customerRepository,
        @Qualifier("some-application") RestTemplate restTemplate) {
    this.customerRepository = customerRepository;
    someApplicationRestTemplate = restTemplate;
  }
}
```

Unfortunately, the `@RequiredArgsConstructor` won't work with `@Qualifier` annotation, so we have to manually define the constructor. An alternative is to use [`@Autowired`](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowire) annotation, but personally, I prefer constructor way to have more control.

*Note: You can also pass the name in other annotations, but the bean names are typically used in*`@Bean`*only.*

## `@Controller`

Back to the class bean again! `@Controller` will **make the class a bean** and semantically indicate that the class is **at the controller layer**.

The controller layer means **this class exposes the API endpoints** for clients to consume.

For example, you might want to allow users to **create a Customer** by `POST`ing to `/customers`

```java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/customers") // The base URL of the API from this class
@RequiredArgsController
public class CustomerController {
  private final CustomerService customerService;

  @PostMapping("") // Accepts POST requests to the base URL
  public ResponseEntity<CustomerResponse> create(
      @RequestBody customerRequest) {
    Customer customer = customerService.create(customerRequest);
    ...
  }
}
```

## Summary

That's pretty much it, some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot. They might seem a little magical, but annotations in Java essentially serve a single purpose

> Annotations provide instructions / metadata to the JVM / compiler to build the codes

As a result, the annotations can add additional codes, like how Lombok's `RequiredArgsConstructor` can generate constructors for you using annotations. Likewise, Spring Boot's `@Component` makes the class a singleton bean.

Beside these bean-related annotations, Spring Boot has many other annotations, and sometimes can only be found **via their documentation**. It does take some form of experience for you to slowly build your understandings and knowledge towards Spring Boot.

*Unfortunately, at least for me, Spring Boot's documentations isn't always easy to navigate*
