Are you still using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for your state management? If you're like me, you probably don't like it too.

Redux used to be my **_nightmare_** while working in React. The states, actions, reducers were **scattered everywhere**, **side effects** in places you least expected, lots of **boilerplate codes** for a single state, etc.

Therefore, we will look into something simpler and more enjoyable state management library today, **Zustand**.

If you decided to follow along the codes but didn't catch up the last parts, check out the codes from my [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part9-deployment).

## State Management

Yes, with tools like [React Query](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/insta-next-exploring-apis-with-react-queries) that caches requests, the need for **temporarily storing requests' results will decrease**. However, there are still moments when we'd wish to pass the data **from one component to another**.

That's where **Global State Management** comes into play, it allows us to create **global data storage** for the frontend. _Context is also an option in React but is_ [_bad for_](https://medium.com/@athletecoder/avoid-usecontext-to-handle-your-global-state-in-react-c12454356e2a) _large-scale performance._

Using my [website](https://shenyien.cyou/projects) as an example, a modal for project details will show up upon clicking one of the projects.

<ImgurImage

  alt="The component tree of my website"

  height={600}
/>

Let's say the modal component is placed on the page level, and the project is nested a few layers down the component tree. The data now is contained in the `Project` component, but required by the `Modal` that is placed under the page.

Without State Management, we will typically be using the plain **useState**. The state will lie on **Page**, while the **setter** will be **passed down** the component tree to `Project` so that the `Project` component can set it during `onClick`, and the `Modal` will consume the state.

Without a single doubt, the complexity will put a lot of cognitive burdens and makes it difficult to maintain the codes, especially as it scales.

/>

Using State Management, everything will be **simplified**. The components only **needed to communicate with the data storage** without having extra props passing down from the top.

Of course, not everything needs state management. Normally, I'll only use State Management when the **flow is complex** and **at least more than 2 layers deep**. _(Take this with a grain of salt, this is just my heuristics)_

## What are we building

In [Part 8](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/insta-next-likes-and-followers), we built a **follow button** that doesn't immediately reflect the follow status after clicking _(it technically does, we used a temporary solution there)_.

The problem with it? The frontend is using **outdated data** and is **waiting for a response** from the backend. Hence, we will fix this issue by **storing an object of followed users** using Zustand. This allows the frontend to **keep track of users that are followed and unfollowed** before receiving updated data from the backend.

_(There might be better solutions, but this works)_

## Zustand

Like Redux, [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) also allows you to manage the frontend's global states in a **simplified manner**. Do check out their docs to learn more about it! I only covered the essentials here.

_Note: Zustand isn't bound to React, it can also be used in vanilla JavaScript and other frameworks._

### Installation

Zustand is only a single package,

```bash
yarn add zustand
```

and there isn't additional configuration required, so we're ready to go!

### Data Store

In Zustand, a store is basically **a hook for a group of related data**. For example, in E-Commerce, you might have stores like `CartStore`, `PaymentStore`, and `UserDetailStore`.

The store will contain the **data**, and any **function that interacts with the data** _(setters, reducers, async actions, etc.)_.

#### Store Type

As usual in the TypeScript world, we will define the **structure of the store** first, let's see, we will store the followed user as an object

```typescript
// src/stores/useFollowedUserStore.ts
// Since it's a hook, the use is in the file name
type FollowedUser = Record<string, boolean>
```

If we click on Follow button, the user's username will be **added** to `FollowedUser` and **set** to `true`. If unfollowed, it'll be **set** to `false` instead. Let's try to combine these functions

```typescript
// src/stores/useFollowedUserStore.ts
...
export interface FollowedUserStore {
    followedUser: FollowedUser;
    followUser: (username: string) => void;
    unfollowUser: (username: string) => void;
    reset: () => void; // added this to reset the followedUser object
}
```

#### Create Store

Next, we will create the store based on the type we defined

```typescript
// src/stores/useFollowedUserStore.ts
import { create } from "zustand";
...
const useFollowedUserStore = create<FollowedUserStore> ((set, get) => ({
    followedUser: {},
    followUser: (username) => {
        set({followedUser: {...get().followedUser, [username]: true}})
    },
    unfollowUser: (username) => {
        set({followedUser: {...get().followedUser, [username]: false}})
    },
    reset: () => {
        set({followedUser: {}});
    }
}))

export default useFollowedUserStore;
```

Using `create` from the Zustand, we will also pass the type created in.

There will be two parameters here, `set` and `get`. `get()` will return the **current state** of the store, while `set()` will **update the store state** with the data.

I.e., If I passed `followedUser` in `set`, only `followedUser` field will be updated, other fields will be unaffected.

And that's it, the amount of work here is like much lesser compared to other state management tools.

#### Persistent Storage

Note that the version implemented above **isn't persistent**, that is, if you close the tab, everything is gone.

While this is the behavior desired for our implementation, you might want to **persist some data** sometimes. For example, you might want to persist user's details until they log out, so closing the website doesn't lose the data.

To achieve that, we can use the [persist](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#persist-middleware) middleware, just simply wrap the store in it, it will use the browser's `localStorage` by default:

```typescript
// // src/stores/useFollowedUserStore.ts
...
// Note the extra () there
const useFollowedUserStore = create<FollowedUserStore>()(persist((set, get) => ({
    followedUser: {},
    followUser: (username) => {
        set({followedUser: {...get().followedUser, [username]: true}})
    },
    unfollowUser: (username) => {
        set({followedUser: {...get().followedUser, [username]: false}})
    },
    reset: () => {
        set({followedUser: {}});
    }
}), {name: "followed-user"}));

export default useFollowedUserStore;
```

_PS: I'm using the non-persistent version_

### Using the Store

It's dead simple to use the store, we just call the hook and that's it

```typescript
const { followedUser, followUser } = useFollowedUserStore()
```

## Fixing the frontend

Let's head back to our `FollowUserButton`, instead of `useState`, we will use the store we created

```tsx
// src/components/users/follows/FollowUserButton.tsx
  // I also removed the modal in this component
...
  const {
    followedUser,
    followUser: stateFollowUser,
    unfollowUser: stateUnfollowUser,
  } = useFollowedUserStore();

  const followUserMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: followUser,
    onSuccess: () => {
      showNotification({
        message: "You have followed the user!",
        color: "green",
      });
      // we will update the state in store directly
      // after successful request
      stateFollowUser(username);
      onChange?.(true);
    },
  });
  const unfollowUserMutation = useMutation({
    mutationFn: unFollowUser,
    onSuccess: () => {
      showNotification({
        message: "You have unfollowed the user!",
        color: "green",
      });
      stateUnfollowUser(username);
      onChange?.(false);
    },
  });
  // Only use data from backend if frontend hasn't record
  const following = followedUser[username] ?? initialFollow;
...
```

Besides this file, there are a few files to update too. However, since this post is meant to be a Zustand tutorial, I won't bother you with the details. Here are the updated files for your reference:

1. Everything except `types.ts` from `src/utils/modals` folder: [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part10-zustand-state-management/src/utils/modals)

   _Just needed to uncomment all the temporary fix from_ [_Part 8_](https://blogs.shenyien.cyou/insta-next-likes-and-followers)

2. `src/components/users/follows/FollowUserButton.tsx`: [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/blob/part10-zustand-state-management/src/components/users/follows/FollowUserButton.tsx)

   _I removed everything about the modal here_

### Optimizing Data

Noticed the `reset` function from earlier? Since the data is _updated_ when we **refetch the data from backend**, we will reset the `followedUser` object after refetching.

To do this, we can simply call the `reset` function after every successful refetch:

```typescript
// src/components/users/UserInfo.tsx
...
  const { reset } = useFollowedUserStore();
  const { data: userInfo, isSuccess } = useQuery({
    queryFn: () => getUserInfo(username),
    queryKey: ["user-info"],
    enabled: !!username,
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      setActualFollowing(data.user.followers.length > 1);
      // Here
      reset();
    },
  });
...
```

```tsx
// src/components/modals/PostLikedModal.tsx
...
  const { reset } = useFollowedUserStore();
  const likedUsers = useQuery({
    queryFn: () => getPostLikeds(postId),
    queryKey: ["post-likeds"],
    onSuccess: () => {
      reset();
    },
  });
...
```

Note that this step is completely **optional**, might even be redundant since the users probably won't follow a lot of other accounts at once.

Moreover, this data will be removed once the user closes or refresh the page, so this optimization is unnecessary.

## Summary

This is a relatively short article in the series since it solely focuses on Zustand.

To summarize, you have learned about the **reasons behind state management**, **how to setup a Zustand store** by creating types and the store itself, and **using Zustand stores in React**.

I hope you can see the simplicity of setting up Zustand _(especially compared to Redux if you have used it before)_, so let's **advocate for Zustand** and **convince more people to use it**! Let's hope that Zustand will become mainstream one day.
