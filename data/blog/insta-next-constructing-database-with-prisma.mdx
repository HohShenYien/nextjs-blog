<TOCInline toc={props.toc} />

In part 1, I created a simple class diagram to show the relationships between the classes.

Picking up from where we dropped off in the last part, I will **introduce Prisma**, convert the class diagram into a **Prisma Schema**, and **migrate** and **seed** the database.

If you decided to skip the first part, no worry, I got you here, you can download the codes from where we stopped the last part [here](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part1-frontend-setup).

## Prisma

### Overview

So what exactly is [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)?

> Next-generation **Node.js** and **TypeScript** ORM

Two keywords here, TypeScript and ORM.

**TypeScript** - All parameters and objects are fully typed when using Prisma, it'll be very useful later when we need to operate on these objects.

**ORM** - Object Relation Mapping, where **rows** in the database (_or document for mongo db_) are retrieved as **objects** in our codes.

In short, we use Prisma to **connect** & **interact** with the database in the form of typed objects. Even better, Prisma manages **migrations** for you, that is, they will help to update the database structure based on the **Schema.**

### Schema

The Prisma Schema is like a database schema, it defines the **database structure** including the relationships between different entities. The Schema uses Prisma's own syntax, so no SQL is needed, its syntax is also simple.

To start off, each table in Prisma will be defined with a keyword `model`

```typescript
model User {
  // The attributes go here
}
```

### Types

Like SQL, Prisma provides a few types for us to use

- String
- Boolean
- Int
- BigInt
- Float
- Decimal
- DateTime
- Json
- Bytes

However, if we want to be more **specific**, for example, if we wish to create a fixed-length string, we can use annotations `@db`:

```typescript
model Model {
  /* myField is char of length 12 in database */
  myField String @db.Char(12)
}
```

### Annotations

Prisma also provides some other annotations for **manipulating database attributes**

1. **@id** - Indicates that this is a primary key
2. **@unique** - All data in this column must be unique
3. **@updated** - Marks that this field will be used to show the last updated datetime
4. **@default** - Default value of the column, aside from fixed value, Prisma allows these defaults to be used

   - uuid() / cuid() - These are unique serial ids, cuid is shorter than uuid, read more about them [here](https://dev.to/harshhhdev/uuidguid-cuid-nanoid-whats-the-difference-5dj1)
   - now() - current time
   - autoincrement() - Increases the integer value, usually for id

The annotations can just be used **beside the field** like the ones above, or here

```typescript
model User {
  id   Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name String
}
```

### Relationships

Relationships in Prisma is like super simple and very intuitive, we just **add a field** of the relationship in the model itself and add the `@relation` **annotation** to tell which column is the foreign key, and the reference key

```typescript
model User {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name    String
  // Prisma will resolve this! Referring to the relationship in Post
  posts   Post[]
}

model Post {
  user_id Int
  user    @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  caption String
}
```

So there's a **one-to-many** relationship, **one-to-one** is similar, we just need to remove the `[]` from `Post[]`.

Meanwhile, **many-to-many** will require intermediate tables, like the UserFollower and PostLike tables from the class design. In essence, they'll look like **two one-to-many** relationships.

```typescript
// I know my formatting is a bit off here, but bear with me for now
model User {
  id          Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String
  // Prisma will resolve this! Referring to the relationship in Post
  posts       Post[]
  posts_liked PostLike []
}

model Post {
  id          Int    @id
  user_id     Int
  user        User   @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  caption     String
  users_liked PostLike []
}

model PostLike {
  user_id    Int
  user       User @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  post_id    Int
  post       Post @relation(fields: [post], references: [id])
  created_at @default(now())
}
```

and that's it! many-to-many relationship. Nevertheless, Prisma also provides implicit **implementation**, where Prisma creates the intermediate table for you, but I usually prefer to do it myself. You can refer to the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations) if you're interested.

### Queries

Lastly, how do we make a query? Certainly, we **aren't going to write SQL ourselves**.

In Prisma, APIs are provided for all the models we defined, for example, to query for the first 10 users (e.g., id &lt;= 10):

```typescript
const users = prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: {
      lte: 10,
    },
  },
})
```

Pretty neat, isn't it? We are using a where to find for id that is less than or equal (lte) to 10. Here's the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-client-reference#findmany) for your reference, but I'll guide you along the way.

## Setting up Prisma & Database

_You didn't think that you can start writing the schema right away, did you?_

As usual, we install the dependencies, and setup our database.

### Installing Prisma

```bash
yarn add -D prisma
yarn add @prisma/client
```

Then, we will use prisma-cli to bootstrap our project with the required setups

```bash
npx prisma init
```

After that, you might see a warning like this

_warn You already have a .gitignore file. Don't forget to add_ `.env` _in it to not commit any private information._

Let's follow the instruction, and add this line into the .gitignore file

```bash
.env
```

And that's it, the Prisma is now available in the system! You can now see the `prisma` folder which contains exactly one file, `schema.prisma`.

_PS: Also remember to add Prisma extension to your IDE, here's the one for VS Code_

<ImgurImage
  size="large thumbnail"
  imgurId="OVh6oWG"
  format="png"
  alt="Prisma extension"
  width={500}
  height={200}
/>

### Connecting to Database

We will first create a database in PostgreSQL (_you can install it if you don't have_). Not sure if you're a command line person, but for databases, I'd usually prefer to use GUI. I'm using is [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to create and [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) for browsing. DBeaver might look a little old, but it's good and solid.

#### Creating Database

<ImgurImage size="full" imgurId="n1BKfSY" format="png" alt="PgAdmin" width={800} height={400} />

After opening the app, just click on the local server (PostgreSQL 14), right-click the Databases and create a Database.

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="XImrOyE"
  format="png"
  alt="Creating new database in PgAdmin"
  width={700}
  height={300}
/>

I'll name it `instanext`, remember the name, we're going to need it later.

Then, just click save, and voila you got the database now!

#### Connecting to Database

Now, head back to your IDE, open up `.env` file, you should see this line in it

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

Prisma is going to refer to the env file's `DATABASE_URL` to find where is the database. Let's update the DATABASE_URL to that of the one we created just now.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:secret@localhost:5432/instanext"
```

If you didn't do any specific configuration, this should look the same for you. The `postgres` is the username for the user of your postgreSQL server, `secret` is the password, and `instanext` is the database name. If you did make some configuration, do change them accordingly.

#### Testing Connection

And..... we're done now! It's time for testing.

Open up your `package.json` and add this line under `scripts`

```json
  "scripts": {
     ....
     "migrate": "prisma migrate dev --schema=./prisma/schema.prisma"
  }
```

So this line basically lets you use the Prisma installed in your project and you tell it that the schema is located at `./prisma/schema.prisma`. Next, run the migrate

```bash
yarn migrate
```

If all goes well, you can see these few lines appearing

```plaintext
Prisma schema loaded from prisma\schema.prisma
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "instanext", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

Already in sync, no schema change or pending migration was found.

Error:
You don't have any models defined in your schema.prisma, so nothing will be generated.
...
```

Oh no, there's Error? **False alert**.

We haven't defined anything in the `schema.prisma` file yet, hence the error. But it shows that Prisma managed to connect to the database successfully, and that's what we need.

## Building the Schema

Finally, here comes the exciting part, let's convert this class diagram into a Prisma Schema.

<ImgurImage
  size="full"
  imgurId="Znl6ADA"
  format="png"
  alt="Class Diagram of InstaNext"
  width={600}
  height={500}
/>

### Basic Models

Let's start with the base entities: **User, Post and Story**, we will ignore relationships for now, open up your `schema.prisma`, add these lines in

```typescript
model User {
  id          Int            @id @default(autoincrement())
  username    String         @unique
  email       String         @unique
  password    String
  description String         @default("")
  created_at  DateTime       @default(now())
}

model Post {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  caption    String
  user_id    Int
  created_at DateTime   @default(now())
}

model Story {
  id         Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  caption    String
  user_id    Int
  created_at DateTime   @default(now())
}
```

Here's a challenge for you, can you write out the model for Image? Assuming id, associated_id and sequence are Int, and the rest are Strings.

<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal the Image Model</summary>
  ```typescript
model Image {
    id            Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
    type          String
    url           String
    associated_id Int
    sequence      Int
}
  ```
</details>

### Relationships

#### One-to-Many

There are a few relationships there, let's go with the easier one-to-many relationships, that's the `User` to `Post` and `Story`, let's add the relationship to Post first

```typescript
model Post {
  ...
  user      User       @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
}
```

You'd probably notice that when you save after writing the relation, Prisma will add a line in the `User` Model. This line ensures that the relationship is **two-way**, `User` can access `Post` and `Post` can access `User`

```typescript
model User {
  ...
  Post       Post[]
}
```

But I'd prefer to name it lowercase with plural form _(grammar, you know)_

```typescript
model User {
  ...
  posts       Post[]
}
```

And you can do the same to `Story`

<details>
  <summary>Click to reveal the Story Model</summary>
  ```typescript
model Story {
    id      Int @id @default(autoincrement())
    caption String
    user_id Int
    user    User @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
}
  ```
</details>

And rename the `Story` in `User` to `stories`

#### Many-to-Many

There's only one Many-to-Many relationship here, which is the **User-Post** to record the posts that have been liked by the user. Don't worry, it's quite simple too, we just need to create an **intermediary model**, `PostLike` and add the ids from both `Post` and `User`

```typescript
model PostLike {
  user_id    Int
  post_id    Int
  created_at DateTime @default(now())
}
```

I also added a `created_at` there. Next, you'd hopefully notice that the IDE is screaming **errors** like this

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="yclsfK4"
  format="png"
  alt="Invalid Prisma error"
  width={500}
  height={300}
/>

Don't panic, it's normal. Since this model's `user_id` and `post_id` combinations must be normal (_You can't like a post twice_), let's create a composite key, this key means that both `user_id` and `post_id` combined will be used as the primary key

```typescript
model PostLike {
  ...
  @@id([user_id, post_id])
}
```

And the error is gone, hooray!

Lastly, we will add the relationship into this model, it's supposed to be the same as above, `PostLike --one-to-many--> User` and `PostLike--one-to-many--> Post`.

```typescript
model PostLike {
  ...
  user       User     @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  post       Post     @relation(fields: [post_id], references: [id])
}
```

Likewise, two fields will be autogenerated in `User` and `Post`. Let's rename those to make them better represent the relationships

```typescript
model User {
  ...
  posts_liked PostLike[]
}

model Post {
  ...
  liked_bys PostLike[]
}
```

#### Self-Referencing relationships

The last relationship that we're implementing here is **User--&gt;UserFollower--&gt;User** relationship. While it doesn't look similar, it's actually just a **many-to-many** relationship under the hood! Let's just copy over the codes from `PostLike` and rename it

```typescript
model UserFollower {
  user_id     Int
  user        User     @relation(fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  follower_id Int
  follower    User     @relation(fields: [follower_id], references: [id])
  created_at  DateTime @default(now())

  @@id([user_id, follower_id])
}
```

Oh no it's error again

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="QA14O6T"
  format="png"
  alt="Another Prisma error"
  width={600}
  height={300}
/>

Not a big issue, it's just that we have two relations that refer to the **same model**, so we can just add a name for each of them to distinguish them from each other, and similarly, in model `User`

```typescript
model UserFollower {
  ...
  user        User     @relation("followers", fields: [user_id], references: [id])
  follower    User     @relation("followings", fields: [follower_id], references: [id])
}

model User {
  ...
  followers   UserFollower[] @relation("followers")
  followings  UserFollower[] @relation("followings")
}
```

If you're confused about the names, think of it this way, if you're the follower, then you must be finding the ones you're following, and the same vice versa.

And... that's it! Our schema is done, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/blob/part2-database-prisma/prisma/schema.prisma) for the complete version.

#### Wait, what about the Image?

Ah that, it's actually called a **polymorphic relationship**, where Image can belong to either of `User`, `Post` or `Story`, depending on the `type`.

Unfortunately, due to the [limitation of Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1644), we can't implement it on the Prisma level. I'll implement it manually later.

## Migration

Finally, let's do the migration! Migration is when we **sync the database with our schema** that was just created. It's easy, just run the `migrate` script we created earlier

_PS: Don't run this script for production environment, we usually use_ `prisma migrate deploy` _for it_

```bash
yarn migrate
```

Then, you'll probably be prompted for a name of migration, I name it `initial migration`. You should see this message if all goes well:

```bash
✔ Generated Prisma Client (4.11.0 | library) to .\node_modules\@prisma\client in 333ms
```

And done! We can now use the Prima in Next.js! You can open up your database GUI client and view the tables being created

<ImgurImage
  size="huge thumbnail"
  imgurId="sMi66Jq"
  format="png"
  alt="The database structure from Prisma migration"
  width={500}
  height={400}
/>

## Seeding

While I'm as excited as you are to get started, sadly, the tables are **empty**. Let's do some [**_seeding_**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database) to fill the tables with arbitrary values

To do that, create a `seed.ts` file under the `prisma` folder, then we import the **Prisma client** which allows us to **interact with the database**.

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

Then, we create a `main` function, and start to create some values, say two users, with 3 posts and a story each, here's the first user

```typescript
async function main() {
  const user1 = prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      username: 'ShenYien',
      email: 'hohshenyien@gmail.com',
      // we will get to encrypting the password next part
      password: '12345abc',
      description: 'I am Shen Yien!',
    },
  })
}
```

But it will start to get tedious with the number of data. It's time to introduce [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/)! A library that helps to generate random data that look legitimate. First, we install the library

```bash
yarn add -D @faker-js/faker
```

Let's create a folder to store functions for data generation to keep them clean. I call these functions factory _(coming from Laravel background)_

```plaintext
prisma
|= migrations
 |- ....
|= factories
 |- image.ts
 |- index.ts  # This is for exporting everything from the same folder
 |- post.ts
 |- postLike.ts
 |- story.ts
 |- user.ts
 |- userFollower.ts
|- schema.prisma
|- seed.ts
```

I'll create the factory for the image, user and post here, you can try for the remaining yourself, or refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/HohShenYien/insta-next/tree/part2-database-prisma/prisma/factories) for my implementations:

```typescript
// factories/user.ts, creating fake users
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

// The return type will ensure the data is valid
export const fakeUser = (): Prisma.UserCreateInput => ({
  username: faker.name.firstName() + faker.name.lastName(),
  email: faker.internet.email(),
  password: faker.internet.password(),
  description: faker.lorem.paragraph(),
})
```

For `Post`, it'll be a little different because **every post requires a user**. I created it as follows: if a user is provided, then I'll use `connect` to connect the newly created post with the user, else, a new user will be created.

```typescript
// prisma/factories/post.ts
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'
import { Prisma, User } from '@prisma/client'
import { fakeUser } from './user'

export const fakePost = (user?: User): Prisma.PostCreateInput => {
  const caption = faker.lorem.paragraph()
  // any date from the past 15 days
  const created_at = faker.date.recent(15)

  if (user) {
    // This is as if setting user_id to user.id
    return { caption, user: { connect: { id: user.id } }, created_at }
  }
  // randomly create a new user
  return { caption, user: { create: fakeUser() }, created_at }
}
```

Finally, for `Image`, we will just create the image url while the `type`, `associated_id` and `sequence` will be passed from outside

```typescript
// prisma/factories/image.ts
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'
import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'

export const fakeImage = (
  associated_id: number,
  type: string,
  sequence: number = 0
): Prisma.ImageCreateInput => ({
  type,
  associated_id,
  sequence,
  // I changed to use unsplash as the default loremflickr
  // was down when I was doing other parts
  url:
    faker.image.unsplash.image() +
    // This is make sure the browser doesn't just retrieve the image from cache
    '/?random=' +
    Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10000),
})
```

Then, we will just call those functions in our `seed.ts` to create whatever we needed

```typescript
async function main() {
  const users: User[] = []
  const posts: Post[] = []
  // creating 2 users
  for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: fakeUser() })
    // attaching a profile picture to the user
    await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(user.id, 'user') })
    users.push(user)

    // each user has 3 posts
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      const post = await prisma.post.create({ data: fakePost(user) })
      posts.push(post)

      // each post has 3 images
      for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(post.id, 'post', k) })
      }
    }

    // each user has 2 stories
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      const story = await prisma.story.create({ data: fakeStory(user) })

      // each story has 1 image
      await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(story.id, 'story') })
    }
  }

  // let's make first 2 users like each other
  await prisma.userFollower.create({
    data: fakeUserFollower(users[0], users[1]),
  })
  await prisma.userFollower.create({
    data: fakeUserFollower(users[1], users[0]),
  })

  //let's make the second user likes every post of first user
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    await prisma.postLike.create({ data: fakePostLike(users[1], posts[i]) })
  }
}
```

Here's the full codes, including the calling part which I copied from the Prisma documentation:

```typescript
import { Post, PrismaClient, User } from '@prisma/client'
import {
  fakeImage,
  fakePost,
  fakePostLike,
  fakeStory,
  fakeUser,
  fakeUserFollower,
} from './factories'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
  const users: User[] = []
  const posts: Post[] = []
  // creating 2 users
  for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    const user = await prisma.user.create({ data: fakeUser() })
    // attaching a profile picture to the user
    await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(user.id, 'user') })

    // each user has 3 posts
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
      const post = await prisma.post.create({ data: fakePost(user) })
      posts.push(post)

      // each post has 3 images
      for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
        await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(post.id, 'post', k) })
      }
    }

    // each user has 2 stories
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
      const story = await prisma.story.create({ data: fakeStory(user) })

      // each story has 1 image
      await prisma.image.create({ data: fakeImage(story.id, 'story') })
    }
  }

  // let's make first 2 users like each other
  await prisma.userFollower.create({
    data: fakeUserFollower(users[0], users[1]),
  })
  await prisma.userFollower.create({
    data: fakeUserFollower(users[1], users[0]),
  })

  //let's make the second user likes every post of first user
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    await prisma.postLike.create({ data: fakePostLike(users[1], posts[i]) })
  }
}

// copied from https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/seed-database
main()
  .then(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
  .catch(async (e) => {
    console.error(e)
    await prisma.$disconnect()
    process.exit(1)
  })
```

Finally, we add the script for seeding in our `package.json` _(I prefer to call it from yarn)_

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

Wait... it's a bit suspicious there. We have never installed ts-node! Let's install it

```bash
yarn add -D typescript ts-node @types/node
```

and we can now run the seeding

```bash
yarn seed
```

If you're like me, and you encountered this error:

```bash
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```

You can update the `seed` command from `package.json` to fix it, [source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68073912)

```json
"scripts": {
  ...
  "seed": "ts-node --compiler-options {\"module\":\"CommonJS\"} prisma/seed.ts"
  // for Windows
  "seed": "set TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS={\"module\":\"commonjs\"} && ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
}
```

and run `yarn seed` again, now you should finally see some data in the tables

You can also use Prisma's own Prisma Studio to browse the database

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

You can now browse the record easily using Prisma Studio if you don't want to use external apps like DBeaver for it

## Summary

Phew, that was a long way to get our database live.

In the next article, we will have a first look at writing APIs with Next.js!
