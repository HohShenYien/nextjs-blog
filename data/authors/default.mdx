## ðŸ‘‹ Hello

Hi, some people call me **Shen** for simplicity. 

I am a Malaysian **Fullstack Developer** who has also been an active **Hackathon Winner**
in my own country. I enjoy solving real world problems with innovation and technology!

I enjoy learning new things by reading, and the idea of myself writing eventually came up, leading
to the birth of my blog. I have been writing for quite a while now, though on and off sometimes.

You can find my different blogs here, from tutorials of frontend to lessons learnt in backend,
discussion of frameworks like Next.js to Spring, and even some of my life stories!
